\section{Intoduction}
In this paper, we present 1) a unified approach for solving the extended Burmester problem by showing that all linear- and non-linear constraints can be handled in a unified way without resorting to special cases, 2) in the event of no or unsatisfactory solutions to the synthesis problem certain constraints can be relaxed, and 3) such constraints can be approximately satisfied by minimizing the algebraic fitting error using Lagrange Multiplier method. We present a new algorithm, which solves new problems including optimal approximate synthesis of Burmester problem with no exact solutions.

   abstract = {To enhance the nation&#039;s economic productivity and improve the quality of life worldwide, engineering education in the United States must anticipate and adapt to the dramatic changes of engineering practice. The Engineer of 2020 urges the engineering profession to recognize what engineers can build for the future through a wide range of leadership roles in industry, government, and academia--not just through technical jobs. Engineering schools should attract the best and brightest students and be open to new teaching and training approaches. With the appropriate education and training, the engineer of the future will be called upon to become a leader not only in business but also in nonprofit and government sectors. The book finds that the next several decades will offer more opportunities for engineers, with exciting possibilities expected from nanotechnology, information technology, and bioengineering. Other engineering applications, such as transgenic food, technologies that affect personal privacy, and nuclear technologies, raise complex social and ethical challenges. Future engineers must be prepared to help the public consider and resolve these dilemmas along with challenges that will arise from new global competition, requiring thoughtful and concerted action if engineering in the United States is to retain its vibrancy and strength.},

Varieties and subvarieties that ave subsets of some Eucledian space defined by the zeros of a finite number of analytic functions are computed and are characterized as closed form equations of surface patches of this volume. The motion of a cutter tool is modeled as a surface undergoing a sweep operation along another geometric entity. A topological space describing the swept volume will be built as a stratified space with corners. Singularities of the variety are loci of points where the Jacobian of the manifold has lower rank than maximal. It is shown that varieties appearing inside the manifold representing the removed material are due to a lower degree strata of the Jacobian. Some of the varieties are complicated and will be shown to be reducible because of their parametrization and are addressed. Benefits of this method are evident in its ability to depict the manifold and to compute a value for the volume.},

A constraint function is defined as one entity is swept along another. Boundaries in terms of inequality constraints imposed on each entity are considered which gives rise to an ability of modeling complex solids. A rank-deficiency condition is imposed on the constraint Jacobian of the sweep to determine singular sets. Because of the generality of the rank-deficiency condition, the formulation is applicable to entities of any dimension. The boundary to the resulting swept volume, in terms of enveloping surfaces, is generated by substituting the resulting singularities into the constraint equation. Singular entities (hyperentities) are then intersected to determine sub-entities that may exist on the boundary of the generated swept volume. Physical behavior of singular entities is discussed. A perturbation method is used to identify the boundary envelope. Numerical examples illustrating this formulation are presented. Applications to NC part geometry verification, robotic manipulators, and computer modeling are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Twelve young females and fifteen elderly subjects performed STS and treadmill walking with and without a specially made supporter, which may be a simple device for aiding STS and/or walking. During STS, electromyography (EMG) was observed from the vastus lateralis of the right leg. The root mean square (RMS) and mean power frequency (MPF) were calculated from the observed EMG. The changing rate of maximal leg acceleration, the third time derivative of the leg position, was also assessed during treadmill walking at a freely chosen stride frequency and speed. A significant decrease in the RMS was observed during STS when wearing the supporter in both groups. A significant increase in the changing rate of maximal leg acceleration was found during walking with the supporter in both groups. MPF significantly increased when wearing the supporter only in the young group. These results showed that the supporter with spiral bone springs reduced physical stress placed on the quadriceps muscles during STS and walking. This ergonomic contrivance will reduce the possible "risk" of stumbling and/or falling in elderly individuals. The reduced physical burden on the quadriceps muscles will also reduce or delay muscle fatigue, which will further result in an increase in the amount of daily physical activities exhibited in physically poor populations.

The Nintendo Wii Balance Board (WBB) has been suggested as a low-cost and widely-available tool to measure weight bearing asymmetry in a clinical environment; however no study has evaluated the validity of this tool during dynamic tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the concurrent validity of force measurements acquired from the WBB as compared to laboratory force plates. Thirty-five individuals before, or within 1 year of total joint arthroplasty performed a sit-to-stand and return-to-sit task in two conditions. First, subjects performed the task with both feet placed on a single WBB. Second, the task was repeated with each foot placed on an individual laboratory force plate. Peak vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) under each foot and the inter-limb symmetry ratio were calculated. Validity was examined using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), regression analysis, 95% limits of agreement and Bland-Altman plots. Force plates and the WBB exhibited excellent agreement for all outcome measurements (ICC = 0.83-0.99). Bland-Altman plots showed no obvious relationship between the difference and the mean for the peak VGRF, but there was a consistent trend in which VGRF on the unaffected side was lower and VGRF on the affected side was higher when using the WBB. However, these consistent biases can be adjusted for by utilizing regression equations that estimate the force plate values based on the WBB force. The WBB may serve as a valid, suitable, and low-cost alternative to expensive, laboratory force plates for measuring weight bearing asymmetry in clinical settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Data from an experimental set-up using a sit-to-stand movement are first collected using the Microsoft Kinect input sensor, then normalized and subsequently compared using the assigned labels for correct and incorrect movements. We show that attributes can be extracted from the time series produced by the Kinect sensor using a dynamic time-warping technique. The extracted attributes are then fed to a random forest algorithm, to recognise anomalous behaviour in time series of joint measurements over the whole movement. For comparison, the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm is also used on the same attributes with good results. Both methods' results are compared using Multi-Dimensional Scaling for clustering visualisation.},

   abstract = {This study characterises weight distribution symmetry between the intact and amputated limbs of unilateral transtibial amputees during a sit-to-stand movement. A total of 12 amputees and 12 age-matched, non-amputees performed the activity for two conditions - rising with and without chair arm-rest assistance. The sit-to-stand movement was divided into five events: Pre-Ascent; Ascent Initiation; Seat-Off; Deceleration; Standing.

The authors explored the challenges to stability control following sit-to-stand when the requirement for horizontal movement of the center of mass was influenced by foot position and their potential effect on the preceding phases of sit-to-stand. Eleven healthy young and 11 healthy elderly individuals performed the sit-to-stand with their feet further away and closer to the chair. Kinetic and kinematic data were recorded. Regardless of foot position, challenges in stability were greater in elderly participants than young participants despite their similar movement time and shear forces. The greater instability in elderly participants, despite their comparable movement characteristics, emphasizes the importance of stability control following sit-to-stand performance. For both young and elderly participants, the sit-to-stand duration and the shear forces were greater in the far condition. However, foot position did not affect the stability measures (i.e., duration of the stabilization phase and the total center of pressure path during the 1st second of the stabilization phase).},

Following simple geometric arguments we derive a natural and geometrically meaningful definition of scalar multiples and a commutative addition of transformations based on the matrix representation, given that the matrices have no negative real eigenvalues. To-ether, these operations allow the linear combination of transformations. This provides the ability to create weighted combination of transformations, interpolate between transformations, and to construct or use arbitrary transformations in a structure similar to a basis of a vector space. These basic techniques are useful for synthesis and analysis of motions or animations. Animations through a set of key transformations are generated using standard techniques such as subdivision curves. For analysis and progressive compression a PCA can be applied to sequences of transformations. We describe an implementation of the techniques that enables an easy-to-use and transparent way of dealing with geometric transformations in graphics software. We compare and relate our approach to other techniques such as matrix decomposition and quaternion interpolation.},

Using an instrumented chair and a videotape analysis, controlled chair rise performances were quantified in three groups of volunteers:  young adults (Young, n = 17, mean age 23 years), elderly adults able to rise without the use of armrests (Old Able, n = 23, mean age 72 years), and elderly adults unable to rise without the use of armrests (Old Unable, n = 11, mean age 84 years).  Rises both with and without the use of hands were observed.  The total time to rise and the percennt of that time spent in the two distinct phases of the rise, the bdy segment rotations used, and the hand forces exerted were measured.  Despite no apparent functional impairment, the Old Able compared to the Young spent a larger percent time in the first phase of the rise and rotated their body segments by different amounts.  When rising with use of hands, the Old Unable compared to the Old Able group took more time and used different body segment rotations and larger ratios of hand force to body weight.  These data quantify chair rise performance in young adults and in elderly adults with differing functional abilities and enable biomechanical analyses of the importance of joint torque strengths and postural stability in that performance.},

   abstract = {Background: Sitting time is a prevalent health risk among office-based workers.
Purpose: To examine, using a pilot study, the efficacy of an intervention to reduce office workers' sitting time.
Design: Quasi-experimental design with intervention-group participants recruited from a single workplace that was physically separate from the workplaces of comparison-group participants.
Setting/participants: Office workers (Intervention, n = 18; Comparison, n = 14) aged 20-65 years from Brisbane, Australia; data were collected and analyzed in 2011.
Intervention: Installation of a commercially available sit-stand workstation.
Main outcome measures: Changes from baseline at 1-week and 3-month follow-up in time spent sitting, standing, and stepping at the workplace and during all waking time (activPAL3 activity monitor, 7-day observation). Fasting total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels were assessed at baseline and 3 months (Cholestech LDX Analyzer). Acceptability was assessed with a 5-point response scale (eight items).
Results: The intervention group (relative to the comparison group) reduced sitting time at 1-week follow-up by 143 minutes/day at the workplace (95% CI = -184, -102) and 97 minutes/day during all waking time (95% CI = -144, -50). These effects were maintained at 3 months (-137 minutes/day and -78 minutes/day, respectively). Sitting was almost exclusively replaced by standing, with minimal changes to stepping time. Relative to the comparison group, the intervention group increased HDL cholesterol by an average of 0.26 mmol/L (95% CI = 0.10, 0.42). Other biomarker differences were not significant. There was strong acceptability and preference for using the workstations, though some design limitations were noted.
Conclusions: This trial is the first with objective measurement and a comparison group to demonstrate that the introduction of a sit-stand workstation can substantially reduce office workers' sitting time both at the workplace and overall throughout the week.

Results. Use of canes and crutches (but not walkers and wheelchairs) reduced both formal and informal hours of care received per week by sample members, there was also evidence of substitution on the individual activities of daily living task level. Use of canes and crutches was also associated with lower out-of-pocket costs for formal helping services.
Discussion. Findings suggest that canes and crutches are effective and efficient home care resources that have the potential to increase the autonomy of adults with disabilities and to facilitate chronic condition self-management.},

Automated assessments have been designed to translate perceived kinematics onto assessment scores that are consistent with expert opinion on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). In addition, automated assessments reveal movement strategies associated with age and disability, like the use of the arms while rising or excess extension at the knees. In this paper, we present preliminary work to translate perceived movement kinematics from community dwelling balance impaired elders onto expert assessments of sit-to-stand health. Our ultimate goal is to create automated tools to identify falls risk, quantify real-world movement changes that result from therapeutic interventions, and perform ergonomic analyses of elders' seating arrangements in the home.},

To improve their daily living activities, the standing-up motion is emphasized in this study as an important daily motion. Synergy analysis is applied to the standing-up motion to extract four important groups of muscle activations (synergies). Furthermore, the effect of synergies on body movement is calculated based on a musculoskeletal model of the human body. Results suggest that the first synergy works as preparation of the motion by pulling the ankle and flexing the hip. The second synergy controls the joint moment of the hip and knee joints to raise the hip and move the center of mass forward. The third synergy controls the ankle joint according to movement of the center of mass. The last synergy stabilizes the posture change from a seated to a standing position. Our findings imply that it is important to train those functional muscle activity to enhance the ability of standing-up motion.},

[Subjects] The subjects were 10 young healthy males without disease and/or present history of illnesses that would affect STS. [Methods] Three kinds of task conditions were adopted: normal STS (condition N), STS with the trunk tilted as forward as possible (condition TM), and STS with the trunk as vertical as possible (condition TV). The kinematic data during STS were collected using a three-dimensional motion analysis system, and the kinetic data were collected by force plates. [Results] The average negative power in the proximal portions of the shank under condition TV was significantly higher than that under conditions N and TM. [Conclusion] Shank forward tilt appears to be primarily a reactive movement facilitating knee extension rather than contributing to moving COG forward. Thus, less trunk forward tilt movement results in the requirement of higher ability of shank forward tilt movement.},

Fourteen elderly subjects aged 79 or over were recruited from the outpatients at a rehabilitation clinic.

As the thickness of the cushion increased, it was difficult to identify the pelvic movement during STS motion, although the trunk was inclined more anteriorily and the load to the knee extensors was greater. Furthermore, three of the fourteen subjects had difficulties performing STS motion when the pelvis was contoured by a thick cushion. These results suggests that if an older person has a knee extensor strength below an appropriate level and/or the cushion thickness is enough large to contour the subject's pelvis, the risk of falling during STS motion is higher.},

We investigated whether patients with knee OA can efficiently perform STS through mechanical energy transfer assessments. Participants were 20 women with knee OA and 17 age-matched asymptomatic controls. The center of mass (COM), segment angles, joint moments, and powers during STS were measured. The negative mechanical work in the proximal portion of the shank, negative mean powers in the distal portion of the pelvis and proximal portion of the shank, and the positive mean power in the proximal and distal portions of the thigh were significantly lower in the knee OA group than in the control group. Patients with knee OA primarily performed thoracic forward lean movement, shifting their COM closer to the base of support provided by the feet alone, in an attempt to achieve stability at and after buttocks-off. However, control ability, which generates and absorbs kinetic energy quickly, was not enhanced in these patients, and their motion was unable to increase absorption of the mechanical energy in hip extensors and reduce the load on knee extensors. Furthermore, STS in patients with knee OA had reduced energy absorption in the knee extensors from the shank forward lean movement after buttocks-off, had reduced knee extensor efficiency, and made greater use of physiological energy. These findings suggest that, from the standpoint of mechanical energy transfer, patients with knee OA do not perform STS efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Muscle activities during the sit-to-stand motion (STS) are characterized by coordinated movements between hip extensors and knee extensors. However, previous reports regarding the STS and lower extremity muscle activities have focused on some quantitative assessment, but little qualitative research. This study aimed to examine the muscle activities of the lower extremity both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Methods
Study participants included 13 patients with knee osteoarthritis (knee OA) and 11 age-matched asymptomatic controls. The task was STS from a chair with a height-adjustable seat. EMG activities were acquired using surface electromyogram. The root mean square signals normalized as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction values (RMS% MVC) and the mean power frequency (MPF) were calculated.
Results
During STS, knee OA patients had increased RMS% MVC of the vastus medialis and raised MPF of the rectus femoris before buttocks-off.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that STS of knee OA patients not only increased relative muscle activity of the vastus medialis, but also enlisted the rectus femoris in knee extension to improve muscle contraction force by activating more type II fibers to accomplish buttocks-off.},

   abstract = {In this study, a biologically inspired control structure to control the sit-to-stand (STS) transfer from a chair is developed and simulated. STS movement is consisted of two main phases. First phase of the movement is before leaving the seat (seat-off moment). In this phase seat reactions forces act on the body parts which are in contact with the seat. The second phase is after seat-off, where the only external forces acting on the body are ground reaction forces. A proper control algorithm of the STS transfer needs to consider switching between these two phases, which correspond to two different dynamical structures. The control structure developed and discussed in this work is based on the MOSAIC structure, proposed first by Wolpert and Kawato [1]. Original MOSAIC structure has a modular architecture which is based on multiple pairs of forward and inverse models of the dynamical system to be controlled, and each module is trained separately to learn one part of a given task. The number of effective modules is predetermined. We have developed a new method to train all modules simultaneously. This method is based on reinforcement and cooperative competitive learning, and the number of effective modules is determined automatically. In this study, the simulation was begun with four modules. Our results showed that only two modules out of four were selected to control the STS task. Responsibility of controlling the task was switched between the two modules around the seat-off moment. In the other words, the two modules were corresponding to the two phases of the STS.},

   abstract = {Objective. To conduct a pilot study to characterize the hand loads, arm joint angles and external moments corresponding to five activities of daily living demanding of the shoulder, for healthy subjects over 50 years of age.
Design. The tasks were sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, cane walking, lifting a 5 kg box with both hands, and lifting a 10 kg suitcase.
Background Arm motion and loading have not been previously studied for functional daily-living tasks involving substantial external loads.
Methods. Motion was tracked using an optoelectronic system. Loads were measured using an instrumented chair arm, a force plate, and gravitational and acceleration loads. Six healthy volunteers (3 male, 3 female), mean age 55, with no history of shoulder problems participated in the study.
Results. Average peak external moments ranged from 12.3 N m for sitting down into a chair to 27.9 N m for lifting a suitcase. Except for lifting the box, which had much lower loads, average peak hand loads varied from 16% to 19% of body weight (114-134 N). The arcs of motion were larger than for seated activities of daily-living studied previously.
Conclusions. The five tasks studied are commonly performed, yet involve large external moments. Lifting represents the greatest potential loading at the shoulder as it resulted in the highest external moments; furthermore, loads larger than those used in this study might be commonly lifted.
Relevance
External moments at the shoulder should not be underestimated, even for activities of daily living. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Design: Cross-sectional study corresponding to the baseline assessment of the EPIDOS study. Setting: Five French cities including Amiens, Lyon, Montpellier, Paris and Toulouse. Participants: 7421 community-dwelling older women (mean age 80.41 +/- 0.04 years). Measurements: Time to achieve FTSS, and SPMSQ score. Age, body mass index, high number of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, regular physical activity, joint pain, quadriceps strength, visual acuity, use of psychoactive drugs, serum albumin, vitamin D deficiency (i.e., serum concentration <10ng/mL), and the influence of seasons and study centers were used as covariables. Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to SPMSQ score (either impaired<8/10 or normal >= 8/10). Results: Compared to their counterparts, the women with cognitive impairment (n=1190, mean 81.51 +/- 0.45years) took more time in performing FTSS (17.8 +/- 0.9seconds versus 16.1 +/- 0.3seconds, P<0.001). There was a significant negative association of SPMSQ score with FTSS (Unadjusted beta=-0.02(95% CI -0.03;-0.01), P<0.001; Fully Adjusted beta=-0.03(95% CI -0.05;-0.01), P=0.003; Stepwise Backward Adjusted beta=-0.02(95% CI -0.04;-0.01), P=0.005), as well as with advance in age (beta=-0.04, P=0.006) and vitamin D deficiency (beta=-0.34, P=0.011). The FTSS limit value in predicting moderate cognitive impairment was set at 15 seconds by a sensitivity analysis (negative predictive value=86%). Conclusion: We found a negative association of FTSS with global cognitive performance. Achieving FTSS in less than 15 seconds made unlikely the existence of a moderate cognitive impairment. FTSS could be used as a tool in primary care medicine to exclude moderate cognitive decline.},

This paper measured the duration unobtrusively and automatically using a pressure sensor array under a bed mattress and a floor plate beside the bed. Pressure sequences were extracted from frames of sensor data measuring bed and floor pressure over time. The start time was determined by an algorithm based on the motion of the center of pressure (COP) on the mattress toward the front edge of the bed. The end time was determined by modeling the foot pressure exerted on the floor in the wavelet domain as the step response of a third-order transfer function. As expected, young and old healthy adults generated shorter SiSt durations of around 2.31 and 2.88 s, respectively, whereas post-hip fracture and post-stroke adults produced longer SiSt durations of around 3.32 and 5.00 s. The unobtrusive nature of pressure sensing techniques used in this paper provides valuable information that can be used for the ongoing monitoring of patients within extended-care facilities or within the smart home environment.},

This paper proposes automated algorithms for the unobtrusive measurement of SiSt timing and symmetry using bed pressure sensors. An integrated signal comprising all of the sensor outputs was analyzed to measure both the bed-departure timing and the timing of three clinical phases within the transfer. Data collected in clinical trials, along with independent clinical video analysis, verified the success of the bed-departure timing algorithm with a mean error of 0.11 s. The phase measurement algorithm showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between younger and older adults in Phases II and III of the transfers, comparing well with studies found in recent clinical literature. The sensor outputs were then used to form sequences of pressure images, and an automated region of interest (ROI) detection algorithm was designed to extract regional signals from the hips and the hands. The final algorithm was designed to measure the symmetry of the body throughout the SiSt transfer from the extracted regional signals. A system accuracy of 93.0% was obtained for the automated symmetry classification of transfers. The techniques proposed in this paper can increase the precision and efficiency in clinical SiSt assessments. Their unobtrusive nature makes them particularly suitable for integration into a continuous monitoring system such as those required within the smart home environment.},

Although both groups combined improved STSreps (P = .001) and vertical momentum (.008), a significant between-group difference was observed for completers only (MANCOVA of posttest group differences, with pretest scores as covariates; P = .04). EB demonstrated a greater but nonsignificant improvement in vertical momentum (P = .095). In conclusion, core stability training added to SB did not result in STS reps improvement. Compliance may modify these results and future larger sample studies should evaluate the impact of core stability training on STS biomechanics.},

The stroke patients were classified into two groups according to the sit-to-stand movement test: the group that was able to stand up (the stand-able group) (18 persons) and the group that was unable to stand up (the stand-unable group) (14 persons). [Methods] Pelvic anteversion and retroversion maximum angles were measured by a manual goniometer attached to an inclinometer. [Results] The maximum pelvic anteversion angles were -1.6 +/- 5.0 degrees, 1.2 +/- 2.8 degrees, and -12.4 +/- 6.1 degrees in the control group, the stand-able stroke group, and the stand-unable stroke group, respectively. A significant main effect of group was found. An angle discriminating between the two stroke groups was found: the maximum anteversion angles in the stand-able group were distributed above -5 degrees. [Conclusion] The maximum pelvic anteversion angle was significantly smaller in the stand-unable group than in the stand-able and control groups.},

[Methods] The timing of events (task onset, maximum trunk inclination, and first heel strike) was determined from the acceleration waveform and compared to the timing determined from a three-dimensional motion analysis (task onset, maximum trunk inclination) or foot pressure sensor data (first heel strike). Regression analysis was used to estimate the fluidity index (FI) from the duration between events and the magnitude of the acceleration peak. The task was performed at two speeds (comfortable and maximum). [Results] A comparison of the timings from two different systems indicated no systematic bias. Specific events could be identified from acceleration data using regression analysis under both speed conditions. In addition, significant regression equations predictive of FI were constructed using the duration between events under both speed conditions. The duration from the maximum trunk inclination to the first heel strike was the best predictor of FI. [Conclusion] Accelerometer data may be used to precisely and conveniently evaluate fluidity. The clinical utility of these data should be tested in elderly individuals or patient populations.},

Rather than one function device, the proposed device is intended to assist in different lower limb activities; namely, sit to stand and walking activities as well as transfer paralyzed patients from bed to wheelchair and help them stand in upright position to improve blood circulation. The device is based on a non-conventional structure of a 3-RPR planer parallel manipulator which has high rigidity due to the parallel structure. It has some interesting kinematic advantages that facilitate structure and control design. Dynamic model for the assistive manipulator is derived using the first type of Lagrange's equations. A PD-computed torque controller is tuned using genetic algorithm. Simulation results prove high performance of the proposed device in terms of the low tracking error and the proper actuator force.},

This article presents the results from a pilot study, the purpose of which was to develop a method for investigating the activity of sit-to-stand, The study describes STS timing and patterns of trunk movement during standing up in a population of 30 normal older adult subjects (mean age, 61.6 years; SD, 7.7 years), Data were gathered using a three-dimensional movement analysis system, CODA-3. Time taken to stand up was recorded, as were the trunk movements of pelvic and shoulder rotation, trunk lateral flexion, pelvic and shoulder lateral shift, and backward shoulder movement to achieve stance. Results show that normal subjects stood up quickly (mean, 1.67sec; SD, .27sec; range, 1.26 to 2.13sec), and despite large amounts of trunk forward flexion and upward motion necessary to achieve the task of standing up, only small amounts of trunk rotation, trunk lateral flexion, and trunk lateral shift were measured during the activity, The identification of these movement characteristics may be beneficial in assisting with analysis of the STS movement pattern.

   abstract = {Sufficient capacity and quality of performance of complex movement patterns during daily activity, such as standing up from a bed, is a prerequisite for independent living and also may be an indicator of fall risk. Until now, the transfer from lying-to-sit-to-stand-to-walk (LSSW) was investigated by functional testing, subjective rating or for activity classification of subtasks. The aim of this study was to use a single body-fixed inertial sensor to describe the complex movement of the LSSW transfer. Fifteen older patients of a geriatric rehabilitation clinic (median age 81 years) and ten young, healthy persons (median age 37 years) were instructed to stand up from bed in a continuous movement and to start walking. Data acquisition was performed using an inertial measurement unit worn on the lower back. Parameters extracted from the sensor outputs were able to correctly classify the subjects into a correct group with sensitivity and specificity between 90% and 100%. ICCs3,1 of the descriptive parameters ranged between 0.85 and 0.95 in the cohort of older patients. The different strategies adopted to transfer from lying to standing up were estimated through an extended Kalman filter. The results obtained in this study suggest the usability of the instrumented LSSW test in clinical settings.},

To perform the motion, three main steps have been developed (1) horizontal distance identification, (2) joint angle determination, and (3) stability control. This step was developed based on Alexander STS technique. Results show that NAO robot is able to achieve halfway stand up from chair height between 9.6 and 12.7 cm automatically. The robot's best performance is at 12.7 cm height with swinging time of 0.52 s in experiment and 0.2914 in simulation. The developed system will contribute to the development of exoskeleton, rehabilitation and evolution of humanoid robot. This system also enhances NAO's ability for medical study on STS motion or as tools in searching for the best chair design.},

   abstract = {Objective. An experimental study of the sit-to-stand transfer in healthy adults with/without arm-support and in paraplegic patients with/without electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscles was performed. The study was aimed to compare the joint torques, momentum transfer hypothesis, and stability of the sit-to-stand transfer in the healthy and paraplegic subjects.
Methods. A planar 3-linkage rigid body model was used to compute the body-segmental linear momentum and the reaction forces and torques at the joints from measured data.
Results. In healthy subjects the arm-support enlarged the support base of the body and thus, increased the postural stability. Strong arm-assistance reduced the maximum hip and knee joint torques by more than 50%. It was observed that the healthy participants rising with arm-support used momentum transfer to facilitate the transition from sitting to standing. The paraplegic participants did not apply the momentum transfer strategy and the sit-to-stand transfer was accomplished in a quasi-static manner. Stimulating the quadriceps, the legs could participate partly in the movement dynamics.
Conclusion. Our results indicate that some significant differences exist between the maneuver applied by the paraplegic patients to stand up and the strategies used by the healthy adults rising with arm-support.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human chair-rise ability reduces according to various factors such as; Age, Incidents, diseases and etc. The Sit-to-Stand (STS) movement strategy modification is a way chosen to compensate the STS inabilities.
OBJECTIVE: Musculoskeletal evaluation of the effects of standing up strategy modification is beneficial for correct selection. The aim of this study is to compute, compare, and classify the biomechanical effects of each STS movement strategy.
METHODS: A full-body human who stands up from seat with three various strategies are modeled and simulated with commercial musculoskeletal simulation software, AnyBody (Anybody Technology, Aalborg, Denmark). A specific algorithm is employed to compute time-histories of the reaction forces between body and seat.
RESULTS: Time-histories of joint moments, joint loads and muscles forces are computed and compared between strategies. Two statistical analyses (Pearson product-moment correlation and paired-samples t-test) are also employed to compare the effects of strategy modification in various aspects. The major finding is that the body joints and muscles reactions to strategy modification are different or even antithetical to each other.
CONCLUSION: A table is derived which depicts the sequences of the body joints and muscles affected from strategy modification from the most to the least. This table could be practical for therapists, physicians, and rehabilitation devices experts.},

The instantaneous angular and linear velocities of a rigid body are expressed as a dual velocity vector, and dual inner product is defined on this dual vector, resulting in a positive semi-definite and symmetric dual matrix. We show that the maximum and minimum magnitude of the dual velocity vector, for a unit speed motion, can be obtained as eigenvalues of this dual matrix. Furthermore, we show that the tip of the dual velocity vector lies on a dual ellipse for a two-degree-of-freedom motion and on a dual ellipsoid for a three-degree-of-freedom motion.In this manner, the velocity distribution of a rigid body can be studied algebraically in terms of the eigenvalues of a dual matrix or geometrically with the dual ellipse and ellipsoid. The second-order properties of the two- and three-degree-of-freedom motions of a rigid body are also obtained from the derivatives of the elements of the dual matrix. This results in a definition of the geodesic motion of a rigid body. The theoretical results are illustrated with the help of a spatial 2R and a parallel three-degree-of-freedom manipulator.},

Two techniques in combination yielded the best results, namely the voxel height in conjunction with the ellipse fit. Accurate STS time was computed on various STSs and verified using a marker-based motion capture system.

These phases help to identify the beginning and end of the transfer and describe the movement performance, therefore characterizing the transition. The methods of phase breakdown, however, vary depending on the source. In this paper, the objective was to distinguish between a vigorous sit to stand transfer and a slower, less stable sit to stand transfer using a different approach. Ten subjects performed two sit-to-stand transfers each on a hospital mattress, while pressure sensors underneath the mattress gathered movement data. The center of mass was calculated and three features were extracted, then evaluated by a classifier to determine if the features could distinguish between the two movements. Examination of the results determined that two of the three features yielded total accuracy, despite inconsistencies in subject performance. These results suggest that the center of pressure can be used to distinguish between slow, unstable sit-to-stand transfers and vigorous ones. Future work will include the examination of center of pressure in the measurement of balance, as well as the overall assessment of sit-to-stand performance.},

Because determining whether (c) improvement would affect STS capability in the motor impaired elderly (MIE) has been recommended, we studied the relative importance of (a), (b) and (c) in determining a successful fast STS movement comparing the healthy elderly with MIE with orthopaedic disorders studied before and after a rehabilitation program. Force platform was used to measure body's posture and kinematics during a STS test and therefore to assess (a), (b) and maximum vertical velocity (VVpeak), assumed as outcome measurement. Knee extensor maximal isometric voluntary contraction normalized by body mass (nMVC) was an indicator of (c). A multiple regression model was built to predict VVpeak from the three determinants of STS movement. In both groups, the model significantly determined VVpeak, with (a) and (c) being significant predictors of VVpeak and (a) being the major predictor. Rehabilitation was effective in improving nMVC. This process resulted in a change of the relative importance of (a) and (c), strength becoming the major predictor of VVpeak. In conclusion the present study demonstrates that a rehabilitative intervention aimed at increasing strength is effective in improving STS capability in MIE. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background. Previous studies have shown that people with Parkinson disease (PD) have difficulty performing the sit-to-stand task because of mobility and stability-related impairments. Despite its importance, literature on the quantification of dynamic stability control in people with PD during this task is limited.
Objective. The study objective was to examine differences in dynamic stability control between people with PD and people who were healthy and the extent to which externally cued training could improve such control during the sit-to-stand task in people with PD.
Design. This was a quasi-experimental controlled trial.
Methods. The performance of 21 people with PD was compared with that of 12 older adults who dwelled in the community. People with PD were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a group that did not receive training and a group that received audiovisually cued training (3 times per week for 4 weeks) for speeding up performance on the sit-to-stand task. Outcome measures recorded at baseline and after 4 weeks included center-of-mass position, center-of-mass velocity, and stability against either backward or forward balance loss (backward or forward stability) at seat-off and movement termination.
Results. Compared with people who were healthy, people with PD had greater backward stability resulting from a more anterior center-of-mass position at seat-off. This feature, combined with decreased forward stability at movement termination, increased their risk of forward balance loss at movement termination. After training, people with PD achieved greater backward stability through increased forward center-of-mass velocity at seat-off and reduced the likelihood of forward balance loss at movement termination through a posterior shift in the center-of-mass position.
Limitations. The study applied stability limits derived from adults who were healthy to people with PD, and the suggested impact on the risk of balance loss and falling is based on these theoretical stability limits.
Conclusions. For people with PD, postural stability against backward balance loss at task initiation was increased at the expense of possible forward balance loss at task termination. Task-specific training with preparatory audiovisual cues resulted in improved overall dynamic stability against both forward and backward balance loss.},

Fourteen young (mean 19.6 +/- SD 1.2 years old) and 17 older (61.7 +/- 5.5 years old) adults completed six STS trials at three speeds: slow, normal, and fast. Sagittal plane joint torques at the hip, knee, and ankle were calculated through inverse dynamics. Isometric and isokinetic maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) for the hip, knee, and ankle were collected and used for model parameters to predict the participant-specific maximum voluntary joint torque. Three different measures of relative effort were determined by normalizing STS joint torques to three different estimates of maximum voluntary torque. Relative effort at the hip, knee, and ankle were higher when accounting for variations in maximum voluntary torque with joint angle and angular velocity (hip = 26.3 +/- 13.5%, knee = 78.4 +/- 32.2%, ankle = 27.9 +/- 14.1% ) compared to methods which do not account for these variations (hip 23.5 +/- 11.7%, knee = 51.7 +/- 15.0%, ankle = 20.7 +/- 10.4%). At higher velocities, the difference in calculating relative effort with respect to isometric MVC or incorporating joint angle and angular velocity became more evident. Estimates of relative effort that account for the variations in maximum voluntary torque with joint angle and angular velocity may provide higher levels of accuracy compared to methods based on measurements of maximal isometric torques.

   abstract = {Objective. To compare patterns of muscle activation in the lower extremity and subsequent forces during sit to stand in persons with Parkinsonism.
Background. There is an interruption of the tibialis anterior/soleus interaction during forward oriented movements in some subjects with Parkinsonism, including sit to stand. This task is a major determinant of independence and 44% of those with Parkinsonism report difficulty.
Methods. 41 subjects with Parkinsonism were asked to stand up from a bench. Peak acceleration and vertical ground reaction forces, the slopes to these peaks, and the timing of events were measured. Surface electrodes were placed on tibialis anterior and soleus.
Results. The slower group produced force at slower rate than the fast group. The slower group spent 64% of the time taken to stand to complete the flexion-momentum phase, and the fast group spent 56%. The slower group had a larger proportion of co-contraction trials than the other groups.
Conclusions. Slower subjects took longer to perform the task due to a longer time for seat off. Deficits recruiting tibialis anterior may contribute to the decreased rate of production of the acceleration forces and the longer time required for seat off.},

Fourteen healthy male adults stood up from a chair with three different seat heights and positions of the feet in the sagittal plane. L5-S1 net joint torque, mechanical work, range of motion and electromyographic activity of the erector spinae muscle were measured. L5-S1 net joint work increased by about 50% from high to low seat position. The mean and peak L5-S1 net joint torques increased about 30% from foot-back to foot-neutral position. These results were reinforced by a greater integrated electromyography signal from the erector spinae from high to low seat position and from foot-back to foot-neutral position. A high chair and placement of the feet behind the knees may be advisable to lessen lumbar load during sit-to-stand movements.},

In this article a novel approach to swept volumes is delineated-one that fully exploits the intrinsic geometric and group theoretical structure of Euclidean motions in order to formulate the problem in the context of Lie groups and differential equations.Precise definitions of sweep and swept volume are given that lead naturally lo an associated ordinary differential equation. This sweep differential equation is then shown to be related to the Lie group structure of Euclidean motions and to generate trajectories that completely determine the geometry of swept volumes.It is demonstrated that the notion of a sweep differential equation leads to criteria that provide useful insights concerning the geometric and topologic features of swept volumes. Several new results characterizing swept volumes are obtained. For example, a number of simple properties that guarantee that the swept volume is a Cartesian product of elementary manifolds are identified The criteria obtained may be readily tested with the aid of a computer.},

We assessed the relationship between maximum rising strength (MRS), a new measurement of sit-to-stand performance, and femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (BMD), taking into account possible confounding variables. The study population consisted of 249 healthy women aged 18-76. We measured MRS with a dynamometer fixed on the ground and connected by an adjustable nonelastic cord to a padded belt. FN BMD was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Women in the first quartile of FN BMD (< 0.702 g/cm(2)) had significantly lower values of MRS, body weight, height, lean mass, past 5-year physical activity expenditures, blood 17 beta estradiol (E2), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and insulin like growth factor 1, and higher values of age and parathyroid hormone than other women. In the logistic regression model, FN BMD values in the lowest quartile were associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [OR(a)] per 10-year increase = 1.84, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.33-2.54, P < 0.001), body weight (OR(a) per 10-kg decrease = 3.67, 95% CI = 2.08-6.47, P < 0.001), MRS (OR(a) per 20-kg decrease = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.02-1.34, P = 0.03), serum DHEAS (OR(a) < 0.5 mg/ml vs a parts per thousand yen0.5 mg/ml = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.3-6.12, P = 0. 01), and serum E2 (OR(a) per 10-pmol/l decrease = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01-1.03, P = 0.03). The present study suggests a significant association between low FN BMD and low sit-to-stand performance in healthy women, independent of possible confounding variables.},

Isometric knee extension force of 31 seated patients (mean age 72.8 years) was measured with a handheld dynamometer. The combined force of both knees was then normalized against body weight. The patients' ability to stand from a chair without using their upper limbs was observed. Independence in the task was correlated significantly (r(pb) = 0.711, p < 0.001) with strength. Regression analysis revealed a positive odds ratio for strength as a predictor of STS independence (1.197, 1.055-1.357). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 93.7%. The normalized strength cutoff point of 46.3% provided the best sensitivity (85.7%) and specificity (88.2%). This study supports previous research showing a strong relationship between normalized knee extension strength and STS independence. The cutoff points of this and previous studies can serve as goals for muscle strengthening for individuals unable to stand from a chair without use of their upper limbs.},

The purposes of this study were: 1) to describe five-repetition STS test (FRSTST) performance (time) by adolescents and adults and 2) to determine the relationship of isometric knee extension strength (force and torque), age, gender, weight, and stature with that performance. Participants were 111 female and 70 male (14-85 years) community-dwelling enrollees in the NIH Toolbox Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function. The FRSTST was conducted using a standard armless chair. Knee extension force was measured using a belt-stabilized hand-held dynamometer; knee extension torque was measured using a Biodex dynamometer. The mean times for the FRSTST ranged from 6.0 sec (20-29 years) to 10.8 sec (80-85 years). For both the entire sample and a sub-sample of participants 50-85 years, knee extension strength (r = -0.388 to -0.634), age (r = 0.561 and 0.466), and gender (r = 0.182 and 0.276) were correlated significantly with FRSTST times. In all multiple regression models, knee extension strength provided the best explanation of FRSTST performance, but age contributed as well. Bodyweight and stature were less consistent in explaining FRSTST performance. Gender did not add to the explanation of FRSTST performance. Our findings suggest, therefore, that FRSTST time reflects lower limb strength, but that performance should be interpreted in light of age and other factors.},

We therefore described STS test times for a sample of community-dwelling adults, examined the association of age, gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) with STS time, and determined the relationship of STS time with self-reported physical functioning. Ninety-four community dwelling adults participated. Repeated measures of STS time were reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.957). The mean STS time for all 94 subjects was 7.6 seconds. Age, weight, and BMI were (r = 0.281-0.528), but gender and height were not (r = -0.074 - 0.007), correlated significantly with STS time. Regression analysis showed that age and BMI explained 43.7 percent of the variance in STS time. The correlation between STS time and physical functioning (r = -0.474) was significant (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that age and BMI added slightly to the explanation of variance in physical functioning provided by STS time.
In conclusion, this study provides STS times that might be useful for interpreting performance of adults screened with the test. Such performance should be considered in light of age and BMI. The relationship of STS time with physical functioning provides evidence of the validity of the measure.},

The study's aim was to compare IMU and MOCAP measurements of dynamic pelvic orientation angles during different activities of daily life (ADL): gait, sit-to-stand (STS) transfers and block step-up (BS) transfers. A single IMU was attached onto the lower back in seventeen healthy participants (8F/9 M, age 19-31 years; BMI < 25) and optical skin markers were attached onto anatomical pelvic landmarks for MOCAP measurements. Comparisons between IMU and MOCAP by Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that measurements were between 2SD of the absolute difference and Pearson's correlation coefficients were between 0.85 and 0.94. Frontal plane pelvic angle estimations achieved a RMSE in the range of [2.7 degrees-4.5 degrees] and sagittal plane measurements achieved a RMSE in the range of [2.7 degrees-8.9 degrees] which were both lowest in gait. Waveform peak detection times demonstrated ICCs between 0.96 and 1.00. These results are in accordance to other studies comparing IMU and MOCAP measurements with different applications and suggest that an IMU is a valid tool to measure dynamic pelvic angles during various activities of daily life which could be applied to monitor rehabilitation in a wide variety of musculoskeletal disorders.

   abstract = {Background. Little is known about the functional performance of patients after revision total hip arthroplasty with major acetabular bone impaction grafting. In general, these patients are assumed to perform worse due to a more advanced stage of periarticular tissue degeneration and multiple surgeries compared with patients with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).
Objective. The main purpose of this study was to quantify the differences in performance of the sit-to-stand (STS) movement between patients with primary THA and patients with revision THA.
Design and Methods. In this study, the STS movement was analyzed kinematically (knee and hip angular extension velocity) and kinetically (loading symmetry ratio). Ten patients after primary THA and 10 patients after revision THA with acetabular bone impaction grafting were compared using these 3 rising parameters.
Results. The patients with revision THA performed the STS movement comparably to the patients with primary THA; there were no differences in knee and hip velocity or leg asymmetry during rising.
Limitations. The study focused only on kinetic and kinematic aspects, and only patients who were satisfied with their THA were involved.
Conclusions. This study showed that patients after a revision THA with acetabular bone impaction grafting and cement did not perform the STS movement differently, either kinematically or kinetically, compared with patients with a primary THA.},

   abstract = {Background. Functional recovery of patients after a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) usually is measured with questionnaires. However, these self-report measures assess the patient's perspective on his or her ability to perform a task. Performance-based tests are needed to assess the patient's actual ability to perform a task.
Objective. The main purpose of this study was to quantify improvement in performance of the sit-to-stand movement of patients with a TKA.
Design and Methods. In this prospective study of 16 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis followed by a TKA, the maximal knee angular extension velocity and amount of unloading (shifting weight) of the affected leg during the sit-to-stand movement and the Visual analog scale score for pain were assessed preoperatively and 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. These data were compared with data for a control group of individuals who were healthy (n=27).
Results. Before surgery, the participants in the TKA group unloaded their affected leg, but within 6 months after implantation, the affected leg was almost fully loaded again and comparable to the loading symmetry ratio of the control group. Furthermore, knee extension velocity also had increased, but remained lower than that of the control group. The changes in knee extension velocity took place during the first 6 months, after which a plateau was visible.
Limitations. A potential limitation of the study design was that the patients were not perfectly matched with the control subjects.
Conclusions. Implantation of a total knee prosthesis partly improved performance of the sit-to-stand movement. Participants in the TKA group could fully load their operated leg, but they could not generate enough knee angular velocity during rising compared with the control group.},

   abstract = {Variable reduction is an important issue in biomechanics, because the definition of a non-redundant set of variables necessary for a complete description of a given motor act provides information about the motor strategy. A systematic tool for dealing with variable reduction problems is Principal Component Analysis. In this paper, as an example of an application of this technique, the set of Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs) provided by a six-component force plate, gained during standing up in a heterogeneous population of 82 normal individuals, was reduced to a set of fewer variables. Each subject was required to stand up from a chair five times at different, randomly self selected, speeds, obtaining a data set of 410 trials. Principal Components (PCs) of GRFs were computed for each trial. On average, over the ensemble of trials, first and second PCs (PC1 and PC2) explained together 90% of the data set variance, indicating that, during standing up, movement of the human body may be reliably described by using two PCs. Inter- and intra-individual repeatability of the first two PCs was investigated by examining the correlation coefficient between PC waveforms obtained from the whole set of trials and within the set of trials performed by the same subject, respectively. While the PCI exhibited repeatable patterns, the second one, although repeatable within the group of trials performed by the same subject, displayed marked inter-individual variability. Therefore, PCI was related to intrinsic aspects of the motor task and PC2 to intersubject features. (C) 1999 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Methods: Eleven women with knee osteoarthritis (mean and standard deviation, age: 66.90, 4.51 years, height: 1.63, 0.02 m, mass: 77.63, 5.4 kg) and eleven healthy women (mean and standard deviation, age: 61.90, 3.12 years, height: 1.63 m, 0.03, mass: 78.30, 4.91 kg) performed a Sit to Stand movement at a self-selected slow, normal and fast speed. Three-dimensional joint kinematics of the lower limb, vertical ground reaction forces and electromyographic activity of the biceps femoris vastus lateralis and erectus spinae were recorded bilaterally.
Findings: A two-way ANOVA showed that the osteoarhtitis group performed the sit to stand task using a smaller knee and hip range of motion compared with the control group while no differences in temporal kinematics and ground reaction force-related parameters were observed. In addition, women with osteoarhtritis displayed significantly lower vastus lateralis coupled with a higher biceps feomoris electromyographic activity and higher agonist-antagonist co-contraction and co-activation than asymptomatic women. The activation of erectus spinae was not different between groups.
Interpretation: Results indicate that patients with moderate knee osteoarthritis rise from the chair using greater knee muscle co-contraction, earlier and greater activation of the hamstrings which results in reduced hip and knee range of motion. This may be a way to overcome the pain and potential muscle atrophy of knee extensor muscles without compromising overall task duration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: It is unclear how people with multiple sclerosis, who often have compromised strength and balance, compare to healthy controls during sit-to-stand movements. The purpose of this study was to compare sit-to-stand biomechanics among three groups: people with multiple sclerosis who exhibit leg weakness, people with multiple sclerosis who have comparable strength to controls, and healthy controls.
Methods: Twenty-one individuals with multiple sclerosis (n = 10 exhibiting leg weakness: n = 11 exhibiting comparable strength to controls), and 12 controls performed five sit-to-stand trials while kinematic data and ground reaction forces were captured. ANOVAs followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests (alpha = 0.05) were used to determine group and limb differences for leg strength, movement time, and sagittal-plane joint kinematics and kinetics.
Findings: Persons with multiple sclerosis exhibiting leg weakness displayed decreased leg strength, greater trunk flexion, faster trunk flexion velocity and decreased knee extensor power compared to the other two groups (p <0.05; d >= 0.87), and slower rise times compared to controls(p <0.03; d >= 1.17). No differences were found between controls and the multiple sclerosis-comparable strength group. Across all 3 groups, leg strength was moderately correlated with trunk kinematics and knee extensor velocities, moments and powers of the sit-to-stand (p 0.05).
Interpretation: Participants with multiple sclerosis exhibiting leg weakness took longer to stand and appeared to use a trunk-flexion movement strategy when performing the sit-to-stand. The majority of group differences appear to be a result of leg extension weakness. Treatment that includes leg strengthening may be necessary to improve sit-to-stand performance for people with multiple sclerosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of speed-dependent BWS STS training for 2 persons with chronic stroke.
Case Descriptions: Two individuals 68 and 75 years old, and 2.3 and 8.7 years post-ischemic stroke, respectively, participated. Both exhibited right hemiparesis, required moderate (25%-50%) assistance for STS, and ambulated household distances with assistive devices.
Intervention: Participants performed speed-dependent BWS STS training 3 days/week for 45 to 60 minutes until able to perform STS independently. Gait parameters, the Stroke Impact Scale Mobility Domain (SIS-mobility), and the 3-Repetition STS test (3RSTS) were assessed before and after intervention.
Outcomes: Each participant completed more than 750 STS repetitions over the course of the intervention, achieving independence in 8 to 11 sessions. Aside from muscle soreness, no adverse effects occurred. Participants also exhibited increased gait velocity (0.17-0.24 m/s and 0.25-0.42 m/s), SIS-mobility score (78-88 and 63-66), and decreased 3RSTS time (18-8 seconds and 40-21 seconds).
Discussion: Speed-dependent BWS STS training appears to be a feasible and promising method to increase STS independence and speed for persons with chronic stroke. In this small case series, a potential transfer effect to gait parameters was also observed. Future randomized controlled study is warranted to evaluate efficacy and long-term effects.},

The Alt–Burmester problems that have, in general, a finite number of solutions include Burmester's original five-pose problem and also Alt's problem for nine path-points. The elimination of one path-point increases the dimension of the solution set by one, while the elimination of a pose increases it by two.

Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis presented diminished knee extensor and flexor muscle strength. There was a weak correlation between knee muscle strength (greater with extensor strength) and postural balance during the act of standing up.
This study aims to evaluate postural balance during the transition from sitting to standing and its relationship with knee extensor and flexor strength among women with and without postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Assessments were made on 126 women (aged 55-65 years), divided into osteoporosis and control groups according to lumbar bone density. Their balance during the task of standing up from a chair was evaluated using the Balance MasterA (R) device. Knee muscle strength was evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (BiodexA (R)), in concentric/concentric mode, at a velocity of 60A degrees/s. Spearman's correlation between the variables of muscle strength and postural balance was evaluated. Subsequently, to evaluate the association of each balance variable with the group and with muscle strength, multiple linear regression models were fitted. The significance level was set at 0.05.
There was a difference in knee muscle strength between the groups (P < 0.05). However, independent of the muscle strength values, there were no differences in relation to weight transfer times (P = 0.556) or center of gravity sway velocity (P = 0.952). Transfer time diminished with increasing extensor strength (P = 0.025). The center of gravity sway velocity tended to increase with increasing extensor strength (P = 0.013) and was the same in the two groups (P = 0.264).
Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis presented diminished knee extensor and flexor muscle strength. There was a weak correlation between knee muscle strength (greater with extensor strength) and postural balance during the act of standing up.},

This study compared the error between hemiparetic and healthy individuals' perception of weight-bearing and their actual weight-bearing distribution during the sit-to-stand task and analyzed the association between the knee extensor muscle strength and the weight-bearing distribution and perception.
Methods-Nineteen unilateral hemiparetic subjects and 15 healthy individuals participated in the study. They performed the sit-to-stand transfer on force platforms under different foot placements (spontaneous and symmetrical) and had to rate their perceived weight-bearing distribution at the lower limbs on a visual analog scale. The strength of the knee extensors was assessed with a Biodex dynamometer.
Results-The hemiparetic individuals presented greater weight-bearing asymmetry and errors of perception than the healthy individuals. Although no significant association was found between strength and weight-bearing perception, moderate associations were found between strength and weight-bearing distribution for both the spontaneous (r=0.75, P < 0.01) and symmetrical (r=0.71, P < 0.01) foot position conditions.
Conclusions-This study revealed that individuals with hemiparesis after a stroke do not perceive themselves as asymmetrical when executing the sit-to-stand transfer and that the knee extensor strength is a factor linked to their weight-bearing asymmetry, not to their perception.

   abstract = {The objectives were to assess whether individuals who are post-stroke can rate their perceived knee effort distribution during sit-to-stand tasks in various foot positions, to quantify their errors of perception and to compare these to their errors in weight-bearing perception. Weight-bearing distribution was assessed in hemiparetic participants (N = 19) using a force platform. Electromyographic (EMG) data normalized to maximal EMG values were used to quantify knee effort distribution. The difference between participants' real weight bearing and knee effort and the perceived values rated on a visual analog scale defined their errors of weight-bearing and effort perception. The perception of effort and weight bearing, and the errors therein, were compared among the four foot positions. Participants perceived only the changes induced by the different foot positions on their weight-bearing distribution, not on their knee effort distribution, and they made greater perception errors with the knee effort distribution than with the weight-bearing distribution.},

   abstract = {The asymmetrical weight-bearing distribution of individuals with hemiparesis rising from a chair might be used to produce similar muscular efforts at the lower limbs. The aim of this study was to determine if individuals with hemiparesis have symmetrical levels of effort at the knee during spontaneous sit-to-stand transfers. Nineteen subjects with hemiparesis and 16 healthy controls participated. Their weight-bearing (WB) distribution during sit-to-stand was assessed with a force platform setup while the knee effort distribution was quantified using electromyographic (EMG) data normalized to maximal EMG values then expressed relative to the sum of the bilateral efforts. The healthy individuals presented symmetrical weight-bearing and knee effort distributions during the sit-to-stand transfer. The participants with hemiparesis, classified in three subgroups based on knee extensors' strength asymmetries (mild, moderate and severe), yielded different results. The mild group (n = 6) behaved like the controls, with almost symmetrical WB and knee efforts. The moderate group (n = 7) had similar WB and effort asymmetries while the severe group (n = 6) exhibited a WB distribution difference between sides but had almost symmetrical knee effort. These results for the severe group suggest that a control is exerted on the levels of effort when rising from a chair, which might be required when a certain threshold of effort is reached on the nonparetic side.

   abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the amount of practice achieved and assess potential for effects on performance of 30 minutes of daily training in sit-to-stand.
Design: Randomized controlled pilot study.
Setting: Stroke rehabilitation unit, UK.
Participants: Eighteen stroke patients needing 'stand by' help to sit-to-stand.
Interventions: In addition to usual rehabilitation the experimental group (n = 9) practised sit-to-stand and leg strengthening exercises for 30 minutes, on weekdays for two weeks, with a physiotherapy assistant. The control group received arm therapy.
Main outcome measures: Frequency of sit-to-stands per day. Performance measures: rise time, weight taken through the affected foot at 'thighs off', number of attempts needed to achieve three successful sit-to-stands and the number of sit-to-stands performed in 60 seconds. Outcome was measured one and two weeks after baseline assessment.
Results: Sit-to-stand frequency averaged 18 per day. Thirty minutes of practice in sit-to-stand resulted in a mean of 50 (SD 17.2) extra stands per day. There was a significant mean difference of 10% body weight taken through the affected foot after one week of intervention: The control group had reduced weight through the affected leg while the training group increased weight (F-1.16 = 11.1, P = 0.004, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.61 to -3.72). No significant differences between groups were found on other measures. Results two weeks after baseline were inconclusive due to loss of five participants.
Conclusions: Task-specific practice given for 30 minutes a day appears promising for patients learning to sit-to-stand.},

   abstract = {Objective: To determine the effect of altering the foot placement of the dominant limb in young healthy subjects and the uninvolved limb of subjects with hemiplegia on their ability to perform sit to stand (STS).
Design: Controlled biomechanical experiment,
Setting: Research laboratory of a university health science center.
Participants: Nonrandom convenience sample of 10 healthy and 10 subjects with hemiplegia. Respective mean ages were 26 and 59 years. All patients with hemiplegia could ambulate and STS independently. The mean time since the stroke was 3.6 years.
Interventions: Subjects came from a sitting to a standing position under 3 different conditions: (1) normal condition, where both limbs were placed in 100degrees of knee flexion; (2) limb extended condition, where the dominant or uninvolved limb was extended to 75degrees of knee flexion; and (3) limb elevated condition, where the dominant or uninvolved limb was placed on a dense foam support equal to 25% of the subject's knee height.
Main Outcome Measures: Vertical and anteroposterior ground reaction forces (GRFs) and bilateral tibialis anterior and quadriceps electromyogram (EMG) activity.
Results: In the young subjects, the normally placed nondominant limb compensated for the extended or elevated position of the dominant limb. Peak GRFs and EMG amplitudes were all significantly greater for the nondominant limb. In patients with hemiplegia, the EMG of the involved limb increased 39171 in the limb-elevated and -extended conditions compared with the normal condition. Respective values for the uninvolved limb decreased. GRFs were significantly greater for the uninvolved limb except for the vertical force in the limb-extended position.
Conclusions: Muscle activity and GRFs can be influenced by altering the initial foot placement of the dominant or uninvolved limb during STS. These initial data have positive implications for the rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegia who could be taught to overcome a reduced ability to use their impaired limb after stroke.},

   abstract = {This paper considers dimensional synthesis of a six-bar linkage with turning kinematic pairs, in the literature known as Stephenson III Six-bar linkage. The synthesis procedure started from the requirement that it should be a double dwell mechanism and that the coupler point, during dwell, should pass through the given points belonging to the circular arc. The coordinates of those points are not directly given; they lie on the circular arc defined by the corresponding centre of the curve and the crank angle that corresponds to the circular arc of the path during dwell. These values are obtained at the end of the optimization procedure so that in this case the precision points change their positions with the change of the position of the arc on which they lie. As this is the case with double dwell, the coupler point should describe a curve containing two circular arcs which does not have to be symmetric. A new metaheuristic algorithm, known as Cuckoo Search (CS), was used in the procedure of optimum synthesis of mechanism parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using a novel lifting mechanism, a walker has been designed to provide sit-to-stand assistance to individuals with partially paralyzed lower extremity muscles. The design was verified through experiments with one individual with SCI. The results show the walker is capable of reducing the force demands on the upper and lower extremity muscles during sit-to-stand transition compared to standard walkers. The walker does not require electrical power and no grip force or harness is necessary during sit-to-stand operation, enabling its use by individuals with limited hand function. The design concept can be extended to aid other populations with lower extremity weakness. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4005786]},

Although many high-quality studies have been performed on these common functional tasks, the objective of the current research is to quantify symmetry indices (SI) of ground reaction force (GRF) and electromyographical (EMG) variables between the non-dominant (ND) and dominant (D) sides of the body in asymptomatic subjects during walking, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit tasks. Thirty-five healthy subjects consented to participate in the study that included collection of bilateral GRF and muscle activity of the back, trunk, and legs during the stance phase of walking and sit-stand tasks. No significant differences in SI values between the ND and D sides of the body were found, indicating that asymptomatic subjects walk, stand up, and sit down in a rather symmetric manner. Gait stance time, peak vertical GRF at heel strike, and peak vertical GRF during the entire sit-stand cycle were found to be "perfectly symmetrical" with SI values equal to 1. Future studies will involve similar analyses to determine the level of asymmetry among symptomatic subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. Workplace injuries from patient handling are prevalent. With the adoption of no-lift policies, sit-to-stand transfer devices have emerged as one tool to combat injuries. However, the therapeutic value associated with sit-to-stand transfers with the use of an assistive apparatus cannot be determined due to a lack of evidence-based data.
Objective. The aim of this study was to compare clinician-assisted, device-assisted, and the combination of clinician- and device-assisted sit-to-stand transfers in individuals who recently had a stroke.
Design. This cross-sectional, controlled laboratory study used a repeated-measures design.
Methods. The duration, joint kinematics, and muscle activity of 4 sit-to-stand transfer conditions were compared for 10 patients with stroke. Each patient performed 4 randomized sit-to-stand transfer conditions clinician-assisted, device-assisted with no patient effort, device-assisted with the patient's best effort, and device- and clinician-assisted.
Results. Device-assisted transfers took nearly twice as long as clinician-assisted transfers. Hip and knee joint movement patterns were similar across all conditions. Forward trunk flexion was lacking and ankle motion was restrained during device-assisted transfers. Encouragement and guidance from the clinician during device-assisted transfers led to increased lower extremity muscle activation levels.
Limitations. One lifting device and one clinician were evaluated. Clinician effort could not be controlled.
Conclusions. Lack of forward trunk flexion and restrained ankle movement during device-assisted transfers may dissuade clinicians from selecting this device for use as a dedicated rehabilitation tool. However, with clinician encouragement, muscle activation increased, which suggests that it is possible to safely practice transfers while challenging key leg muscles essential for standing. Future sit-to-stand devices should promote safety for the patient and clinician and encourage a movement pattern that more closely mimics normal sit-to-stand biomechanics.},

   abstract = {Mechanical sit-to-stand devices assist patient transfers and help protect against work-related injuries in rehabilitation environments. However, observational differences between patient's movements within devices compared to normal sit-to-stand transfers deter clinician use. This study compared kinematics and muscle demands during sit-to-stand transfers with no device (ND), and device-assisted during which participants exerted no effort (DA-NE) and best effort (DA-BE). Coefficient of multiple correlations (CMCs) compared kinematic profiles during each device-assisted condition to ND. Compared to DA-NE, CMCs were higher during DA-BE at the hip, knee, and ankle. However, DA-BE values were lower than DA-NE at the trunk and pelvis due to the device's mechanical constraints. In general, all joints' final DA-NE postures were more flexed than other conditions. Electromyographic was significantly lower during DA-NE compared to ND for all muscles except lateral hamstring, and during DA-BE compared to ND for gluteus maximus, gastrocnemius, and soleus. Verbal encouragement (DA-BE) significantly increased medial hamstring, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior activation compared to DA-NE. In conclusion, device-assisted sit-to-stand movements differed from normal sit-to-stand patterns. Verbally encouraging best effort during device-assisted transfers elevated select lower extremity muscle activation and led to greater similarity in hip, knee and ankle movement profiles. However, trunk and pelvis profiles declined. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The numerical experiments follow the analysis of how the distribution of points on the curve affects the Fourier coefficients. By means of the Fourier coefficients a distance norm between two curves is introduced to measure their similarity. The effect of the curve shape on convergence of the norm is investigated on the examples of the curves generated by four-bar linkages using "Mathematica" software.

One simple application is a method for smooth averaging of quaternions, which generalizes Shoemake's spherical linear interpolation.The weighted averages methods allow a novel method of defining Bezier and spline curves on spheres, which provides direct generalization of Bezier and B-spline curves to spherical spline curves. We present a fast algorithm for spline interpolation on spheres. Our spherical splines allow the use of arbitrary knot positions; potential applications of spherical splines include smooth quaternion curves for applications in graphics, animation, robotics, and motion planning.},

In this paper, in order to make clear usefulness and limitation of a traditional simple inverted pendulum model in balance prediction in sit-to-stand movements, the traditional simple model was compared to an inertia (rotational radius) variable inverted pendulum model including multiple-joint influence in the balance predictions. The predictions were tested upon experimentation with six healthy subjects. The evaluation showed that the multiple-joint influence model is more accurate in predicting balance under demanding sit-to-stand conditions. On the other hand, the evaluation also showed that the traditionally used simple inverted pendulum model is still reliable in predicting balance during sit-to-stand movement under non-demanding (normal) condition. Especially, the simple model was shown to be effective for sit-to-stand movements with low center of mass velocity at the seat-off. Moreover, almost all trajectories under the normal condition seemed to follow the same control strategy, in which the subjects used extra energy than the minimum one necessary for standing up. This suggests that the safety considerations come first than the energy efficiency considerations during a sit to stand, since the most energy efficient trajectory is close to the backward fall boundary.},

   abstract = {The Alexander Technique (AT) is used to improve postural and movement coordination and has been reported to be clinically beneficial, however its effect on movement coordination is not well-characterized. In this study we examined the sit-to-stand (STS) movement by comparing coordination (phasing, weight-shift and spinal movement) between AT teachers (n = 15) and matched control subjects (n = 14). We found AT teachers had a longer weight-shift (p < 0.001) and shorter momentum transfer phase (p = 0.01), than control subjects. AT teachers also increased vertical foot force monotonically, rather than unweighting the feet prior to seat-off, suggesting they generate less forward momentum with hip flexors. The prolonged weight-shift of AT teachers occurred over a greater range of trunk inclination, such that their weight shifted continuously onto the feet while bringing the body mass forward. Finally. AT teachers had greatly reduced spinal bending during STS (cervical, p < 0.001; thoracic, p < 0.001; lumbar, p < 0.05). We hypothesize that the low hip joint stiffness and adaptive axial postural tone previously reported in AT teachers underlies this novel "continuous" STS strategy by facilitating eccentric contractions during weight-shift.

Main Outcome Measures: Differential latency and electromyography (EMG) activity of the tibialis anterior, soleus, quadriceps, and hamstring muscles of the affected leg as well as the movement time, time of seat-off, weight symmetry, and rising index were obtained while the subjects performed the STS movements by using 4 different strategies: spontaneous; symmetric; asymmetric-1, with the affected foot behind; and asymmetric-2, with the unaffected foot behind.
Results: Compared with the spontaneous strategy, the soleus showed the greatest differential latency in the asymmetric-2 strategy, the hamstrings had lower EMG activity in the symmetric strategy, and the movement time was greater in the asymmetric strategies.
Conclusions: The asymmetric 2 strategy appeared to be the least favorable, whereas the spontaneous and the symmetric strategies appeared to be more favorable in improving the STS performance. Based on these findings, allowing the subjects to adopt the spontaneous strategy or training of the symmetric strategy could result in greater benefits for subjects with higher chronicity and higher functional levels, such as those evaluated in the present study.},

Design. Descriptive and correlational.
Background. Measures and treatments are best selected after specific limitations in functional activities (e.g., sit-to-stand) and related impairments are identified.
Method. Fifteen patients, 29-77 (mean = 53.7) years with recent stroke and 15 demographically matched healthy controls participated. Physical performance variables measured were standing balance, maximum paretic extremity weight-bearing, and knee extension strength. Sit-to-stand and curb-climbing performance were characterized using kinetic energy and task duration. Differences in physical and functional performance between groups were determined. Spearman correlations were calculated between patients' physical impairments and sit-to-stand and curb-climbing performance.
Results. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated reduced kinetic energy (P less than or equal to 0.003) and prolonged duration (P less than or equal to 0.001) for sit-to-stand and curb-climbing. Significant relationships (r(s) = 0.49-0.50) were demonstrated between sit-to-stand kinetic energy and knee extension strength, standing balance, and maximum weight-bearing. For curb climbing, significant relationships (r(s) = 0.45) were found between kinetic energy and standing balance and maximum weight-bearing.
Conclusion. Impaired balance and maximum weight-bearing are relevant to sit-to-stand and curb-climbing limitations after stroke.},

   abstract = {Objective: To examine the effectiveness of intensive practice of sit-to-stand on motor performance, exercise capacity and exercise efficiency in traumatic brain-injured patients during early inpatient rehabilitation.
Design: Single-blind randomized controlled pilot study.
Setting: Brain injury rehabilitation unit.
Subjects: Twenty-four subjects who had recently sustained a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) were randomized into an experimental (n = 13) and a control (n = 11) group.
Interventions: In addition to their usual rehabilitation programme, subjects in the experimental group participated in four weeks of intensive training of sit-to-stand and step-up exercises with the aim of improving performance of sit-to-stand. The control group did no additional sit-to-stand or step-up training.
Main outcome measures: Total number of sit-to-stands in 3 min as a measure of motor performance; peak oxygen consumption during a maximal 3-min sit-to-stand test (VO(2)peak) as a measure of exercise capacity; oxygen consumption during a 3-min equivalent workload sit-to-stand test (VO(2)equiv) as a measure of exercise efficiency. Pre- and post-training measurements were made.
Results: The exercise programme resulted in a 62% improvement in motor performance (number of repetitions of sit-to-stand in 3 min) for the experimental group compared with the control group's 18% improvement (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between groups for changes in exercise capacity or efficiency. In the experimental group, the increase in VO(2)peak from pre-test to post-test correlated with the increase in sit-to-stand repetitions (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Intensive task-specific training is recommended as an important component of rehabilitation early following severe traumatic brain injury.},

An impedance control method was introduced to assure patients safely and effectively stand up in their normal posture. In standing up process human segment rotational angles, movement trajectories, ground reaction forces (GRF), center of pressure (COP) and rope tensile forces were measured by sensors, then the moments of ankle, knee and hip joint were calculated. To validate the effectiveness of the trainer system, sit-to-stand training experiments were implemented on four volunteers. Experimental results validate that the system can insure patients complete the stand up process in their comfortable posture, and that the peak joint moments in impedance training were lower than the joint moments by self-support standing. Furthermore, we noted that in impedance training the joint moments fluctuate around the peak values, which means the trainer system could improve athletic ability of the joint effectively. Therefore, the system is suitable for home-training in which patients could control the training process independently and safely, and it can be applied to assess sit-to-stand dynamic parameters and improve the rehabilitation of patients in clinical settings.},

   abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of total hip arthroplasty and hip resurfacing arthroplasty on limb loading symmetry before, and after, hip reconstruction surgery during a sit-to-stand task.
Methods: Fourteen patients were recruited that were about to receive either a total hip prosthesis (n = 7) or a hip resurfacing prosthesis (n = 7), as well as matched controls. Patients performed a sit-to-stand movement before, 3 months after, and 12 months after surgery. Peak vertical ground reaction force and impulse were measured for each leg, from which ground reaction force and impulse symmetry ratios were calculated.
Findings: Before surgery, hip resurfacing patients showed a small asymmetry which was not different to normal for ground reaction force (0.88(028) vs. 1.00(0.11); p = 0311) or impulse (0.87(029) vs. 0.99(0.09); p = 0324) symmetry ratios. Total hip patients offloaded their affected hip by 30% in terms of impulse symmetry ratio (0.71(0.36) vs. 0.99(0.23); p = 0.018). At 3 months following surgery asymmetries were seen that were different to normal in both hip resurfacing patients for ground reaction force (0.77(0.16); p = 0.007), and total hip patients for ground reaction force (0.70(0.15); p = 0.018) and impulse (0.72(0.16); p = 0.011) symmetry ratios. By 12 months after surgery total hip patients regained a symmetrical loading pattern for both ground reaction force (0.95(0.06); p = 0.676) and impulse (1.00(0.06); p = 0.702) symmetry ratios. Hip resurfacing patients, however, performed the task by overloading their operated hip, with impulse symmetry ratio being larger than normal (1.16(0.16);p = 0.035).
Interpretation: Physiotherapists should appreciate the need for early recovery of limb loading symmetry as well as subsequent differences in the responses observed with different prostheses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Prolonged sedentary behavior is an independent risk factor for many negative health outcomes. Although many employers have begun introducing sit-stand desks as means of reducing employee's occupational sitting time, few studies have examined the impact of prolonged access to such desks on sitting/standing time or cardiometabolic outcomes. The present study compared occupational sedentary/physical activity behaviors and cardiometabolic biomarkers among employees with long-term access to traditional sitting and sit-stand desks.
Methods: This study used a naturalistic, cross-sectional study design. Occupational sedentary and physical activity behaviors and cardiometabolic health outcomes were collected in a controlled laboratory between February and June 2014. Data were analyzed in September 2014. Adults working in full-time sedentary desk jobs who reported having either a sit-stand desk (n = 31) or standard sitting desk (n = 38) for a minimum of 6 months were recruited.
Results: Employees with sit-stand desks sat less (p = 0.02) and stood more at work (p = 0.01) compared with employees with sitting desks. Significant inverse correlations were observed between several occupational physical activity outcomes (walking time, steps at work) and cardiometabolic risk factors (systolic blood pressure, weight, lean mass, BMI) over the entire sample.
Conclusions: Employees with long-term access to sit-stand desks sat less and stood more compared with employees with sitting desks. These findings hold public health significance, as sit-stand desks represent a potentially sustainable approach for reducing sedentary behavior among the large, growing number of sedentary workers at increased risk for sedentariness-related pathologies.

   abstract = {Introduction: Recently, it has been demonstrated that biomechanical parameters measured with accelerometers during everyday activities might provide early information about mobility in seniors. The use of smartphones has been suggested for this purpose. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a smartphone-based application for the quantification of the sit-to-stand movement (STS) in healthy seniors.
Methods: Sixteen healthy seniors performed the STS with a smartphone first attached to the lower back and then to the sternum. The subjects' vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) and vertical acceleration (VAcc) were recorded simultaneously using two force plates (reference standard) and the smartphone, respectively. VAcc data were converted to force; power was then calculated based on both force-time curves. Subsequently, the total movement duration (T-total), peak force (F-max), rate of force development (RFD) and peak power (P-max) were determined. Relative (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and absolute (standard error of measurement [SEM]) reliability were also calculated. For the variables showing strong reliability (ICC >= 0.75), Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between VGRF- and VAcc-derived data and one-sample T-tests for the mean differences were carried out.
Results: In the sternal configuration, all variables showed strong reliability (range: 0.86-0.93), except the smartphone-derived parameter RFD (ICC = 0.43). F-max and T-total were found to be highly valid (r = 0.86 and 0.98, respectively).
Conclusion: The results showed that the smartphone-based application can be used as a reliable and valid tool for the quantification of the STS in healthy seniors if the proposed protocol is followed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Thus, in a spatial motion, the screwer performs a displacement of the screwen. Under this context, the Lie product represents the change of the screwen due to the infinitesimal motion performed by the screwer. To this end, this paper sets forth an integrated formulation that brings together a general geometric interpretation of the Lie product and a novel and simple derivation of the Lie product in terms of the involved screws. Moreover, since the formulation is purely geometric, a great deal of physical insight into the description of the motion problem is gained. As a result, the screw partial derivatives, in terms of the involved Lie products, are obtained for three frequently encountered types of kinematic joints, namely, helical, revolute and prismatic. Since the derivation of the Lie product is completely general, this derivation should provide a sound foundation for further applications of the Lie product. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Neuroprostheses utilizing functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) are able to restore standing and stepping after SCI by actively contracting the paralyzed muscles. The stand-to-sit maneuver, however, requires good control of eccentric contractions of the knee and hip musculature, which is difficult to achieve with FNS alone. This preliminary study compares the biomechanics of the stand-to-sit maneuver with open-loop FNS to able-bodied in terms of upper extremity forces and sitting impact force. With FNS, the upper extremity forces reached an average of 25% of their body weight more than able-bodied controls during the maneuver. Individuals with SCI also exhibited twice the impact force when making contact with the chair as compared to able-bodied subjects. These large forces and quick descents are potential for injury and an improved method for controlling the stand-to-sit maneuver when using FNS is necessary.},

   abstract = {Standing up, standing, and walking functions can be restored to people with spinal cord injury by contracting the paralyzed hip, knee, and ankle muscles with electrical stimulation. Restoring these functions using electrical stimulation requires controlled activation to provide coordinated movements. However, the stand-to-sit (STS) maneuver involves eccentric contractions of the quadriceps to control lowering of the body to the seated position, which is difficult to achieve with stimulation alone and presents unique challenges to lower-limb neuroprostheses. In this study, we examined the biomechanics of the STS maneuver in five nondisabled individuals and five users of an implanted neuroprosthesis. Neuroprosthesis users relied heavily on their upper limbs during STS, with peak supporting forces approximately 25% body weight, and exhibited an average vertical acceleration at the impact six times higher than that of the nondisabled subjects (p < 0.001). Sitting with stimulation resulted in impact forces at initial contact with the seating surface averaging 1.4 times body weight and representing an average of twice the impact forces of the nondisabled subjects (p < 0.001). These results indicate a need for additional interventions to better control descent, minimize impact, and gently transition from standing to sitting to achieve a more natural movement and reduce the risk of injury.},

   abstract = {Background: Users of neuroprostheses employing electrical stimulation (ES) generally complete the stand-to-sit (STS) maneuver with high knee angular velocities, increased upper limb support forces, and high peak impact forces at initial contact with the chair. Controlling the knee during STS descent is challenging in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to the decreasing joint moment available with increased knee angle in response to ES.
Methods: The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of incorporating either (1) a coupling mechanism that coordinates hip and knee flexion or (2) a mechanism that damps knee motion to keep the knee angular velocity constant during the STS transition. The coupling and damping were achieved by hydraulic orthotic mechanisms. Two subjects with SCI were enrolled and each served as their own controls when characterizing the performance of each mechanism during STS as compared to stimulation alone. Outcome measures such as hip-knee angle, knee angular velocity, upper limb support force, and impact force were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the two mechanisms in providing controlled STS.
Results: The coordination between the hip and knee joints improved with each orthotic mechanism. The damping and hip-knee coupling mechanisms caused the hip and knee joint ratios of 1:1.1 and 1:0.99, respectively, which approached the 1: 1 coordination ratio observed in nondisabled individuals during STS maneuver. The knee damping mechanism provided lower (p < 0.001) and a more constant knee angular velocity than the hip-knee coupling mechanism over the knee range of motion. Both the coupling and damping mechanisms were similarly effective at reducing upper limb support forces by 70 % (p < 0.001) and impact force by half (p <= 0.001) as compared to sitting down with stimulation alone.
Conclusions: Orthoses imposing simple kinematic constraints, such as 1:1 hip-knee coupling or knee damping, can normalize upper limb support forces, peak knee angular velocity, and peak impact force during the STS maneuvers.},

   abstract = {Objective: To describe the characteristics of leg muscle activation patterns in hemiplegic stroke patients during the movement of rising from a chair and to determine the differences of leg muscle activation patterns between stroke fallers and nonfallers.
Design: Subjects stood up from an armless chair at a comfortable, self-paced speed. Leg muscle activation time and patterns during the sit-to-stand movement were analyzed using multichannel surface electromyography and a force platform. The differences between stroke fallers and nonfallers were compared.
Results: The mean onset time of muscle activity in the affected limbs of stroke fallers was markedly delayed for the tibialls anterior muscle and earlier for the soleus muscle. The muscle activation patterns in the affected side of the stroke fallers exhibited a wide range of variation. Seventy percent of our stroke fallers exhibited no or merely low-amplitude activity in their tibialls anterior muscle when the patients were rising from a chair. Half of the stroke fallers exhibited premature or excessive activation of their soleus muscle when the rising activity was initiated.
Conclusions: Stroke patients who exhibited no or low-amplitude muscle activity in the tibialls anterior, associated with premature or excessive activation of the soleus muscle in their hemiplegic limbs, when rising from a chair were prone to falling. The compensatory excessive tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscle activation in the unaffected limbs of stroke patients might have a role in preventing them from falling.},

Design: A retrospective study, using a force platform to assess sit-to-stand performance and to determine its correlation with falls in stroke patients. Setting: Hospital-based rehabilitation units. Methods: Thirty-three stroke patients (18 fallers, 15 nonfallers) and 25 age-matched healthy subjects were included in this study. Subjects sat in an adjustable chair with their feet on two force plates and performed the standing up/sitting down move ment at a self-paced, comfortable speed. Results: The rate of rise in force (dF/dT) was significantly lower in stroke fallers than in stroke nonfallers and healthy subjects (23.78 +/- 17.38, 55.23 +/- 31.24, and 85.96 +/- 42.4 percent body weight per second, respectively [p < .005]). The center of pressure sway in mediolateral direction during rising/sitting down was much greater in stroke fallers than in stroke nonfallers or healthy subjects (p < .05). Body weight distribution was asymmetric on the feet of stroke patients, with much more body weight on their sound side. Conclusions: The significantly lower rate of rise in force and greater postural sway while rising/sitting down may be useful in identifying stroke patients who are at risk for falling.

   abstract = {Sit-to-stand (STS) movements are essential for daily activities. Failure to perform STS movements efficiently and smoothly may lead to falls. In this study, we developed a forceplate to analyze vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), STS duration and generated muscle power to investigate which parameters were fall status predictors. A total of 105 participants were included in this study and were grouped into those (1) aged between 20 and 30 years (Young), (2) aged above 65 years without a history of falling (Non-fallers) and (3) aged above 65 with a history of falling in the past 12 months (Fallers). The results indicated a significantly higher maximal lower limb muscle power (MP) for the Young (9.05 +/- 3.66 W/kg), followed by Non-fallers (5.50 +/- 2.02 W/kg) and Fallers (3.66 +/- 1.45 W/kg) as well as higher modified falls efficacy scale (MFES) scores for the Young (Young: 9.88 +/- 0.10; Non-fallers: 6.27 +/- 1.40; Fallers: 4.83 +/- 0.89) and shorter times for the five times sit-to-stand test (FSTST) for the young (Young: 6.09 +/- 2.20 s; Non-fallers: 15.65 +/- 3.30 s; Fallers: 19.82 +/- 4.46 s). There was a significant difference between the Young group and the Non-fallers in the maximal vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) (138.79 +/- 24.20 N/BW in Young, 117.51 +/- 8.57 N/BW in old Non-fallers, p < 0.01), and there was a significant difference between the Non-falters and the Fallers in the duration of the STS movement (2.74 +/- 0.87 s for the Non-fallers, 4.27 +/- 2.56 s for the Fallers, p < 0.01). The regression analysis results further indicated that only MP and the STS stabilization phase could differentiate individuals who had past fall events. Therefore, the equipment we developed could potentially be useful in the assessment and monitoring of balance and the risk of falling in older people. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, designers may have determined the installation position of handrails using intuition and trial and error. The aim of this study is to determine the optimum position and orientation of handrails by minimizing the quantified physical load of the STS movement. Twelve university students participated, and eight electromyograms (EMGs), namely, of the brachioradialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, extensor carpi radialis longus, latissimus dorsi, right and left rectus femoris, and right and left tibialis anterior, were recorded. Observations with handrails at various tilt angles and forward distances from the edge of the seat were analyzed for the optimization. The total physical load (TPL) function was formulated as the weighted sum of the EMGs. The weight coefficients were determined by maximizing the correlation coefficient between the measured subjective scores and the TPL function values. The result shows that the handrail installation position significantly affects all of the EMGs except those of the right and left rectus femoris. The weight coefficients of the TPL function are positive for the upper limb muscles, whereas they are zero for the lower limb muscles. The handrail position for multiple users was formulated to minimize the TPL function, and hence the optimum position was determined.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a swept envelope approach to determining tool position for five-axis ruled surface machining. The initial tool position is traditionally located to contact with two directrices of a ruled surface. The swept profile of the tool is then determined based on the tool motion. By comparing the swept profile with the ruled surface, the tool position is corrected to avoid machining errors. The cutter's swept envelope is further constructed by integrating the intermediate swept profiles, and applied to NC simulation and verification. This paper presents the explicit solution for the swept profile of a taper-end cutter in five-axis ruled surface machining. The relation of the ruled surface geometry, the tool motion and the machining errors is developed. Therefore, the error sources can be detected early and prevented during tool path planning. The explicit swept envelope indicates that the machined surface is not a ruled surface in five-axis ruled surface machining. Manufacturing industries should take extra care in high precision ruled surface machining. Computer illustrations and example demonstrations are shown in this paper. The results reveal that the developed method can accurately position tool location and reduce machining errors for five-axis ruled surface machining. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Changes in vastus medialis oblique, vastus lateralis activation and the vastus medialis oblique/vastus lateralis ratio were analyzed. [Results] Vastus medialis oblique and vastus lateralis muscle activation significantly increased in neutral pelvic tilt position, but the vastus medialis oblique/vastus lateralis ratio was not statistically different.

   abstract = {Background Sit-to-stand (STS) movement is useful for evaluating lower limb muscle function, especially from force platforms. Nevertheless, due to a lack of standardization of the STS movement (e.g., position, subject's instructions, etc.), it is difficult to compare results obtained in previous studies.
Aims The aim of the present study was to determine the most relevant condition, parameters, and number of trial to perform STS movements.
Methods In this study, STS mechanical (maximal and mean force, impulse) and temporal parameters were measured in the vertical, medio-lateral and antero-posterior axes using a force platform. Five STS conditions (i.e., with or without armrests, variation of the height of the chair and the movement speed) were analyzed to evaluate repeatability of different standardized procedures.
Results Most of the mechanical and temporal parameters were influenced by the STS condition (p < 0.05). Regarding vertical axis, results showed a strong to perfect repeatability for all parameters (0.72 < ICC < 0.9) for only one condition: STS performed as rapidly as possible with a 90 degrees knee angle when seated, without using armrests. Regardless conditions of performance, our results also showed that the most repeatable parameters were mean and peak force in medio-lateral axis, and the impulse measured in the three directions. Three trials should be performed to reach high repeatability.
Conclusion Our results suggest that the fast condition, with a 90 degrees knee joint angle, with arms crossed over the chest, is the most reliable condition to evaluate performance during STS movement.},

Objectives: To examine changes in weight-bearing (WB) asymmetry during sit-stand transitions for individuals during the first 6 months after unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Relationships between WB asymmetry, clinical measures of knee impairment, and functional mobility also were evaluated.
Design: Prospective repeated-measures design.
Setting: Clinical research laboratory.
Participants: People (N=36) with knee osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled to undergo unilateral TKA and a control (CTL) group (N=17 healthy people) were enrolled.
Intervention: The TKA group participated in acute, home, and outpatient phases of exercise-based rehabilitation.
Main Outcome Measures: WB asymmetry measured during a 5-Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST) based on average vertical ground reaction force under each foot, self-reported knee pain using a numerical pain rating scale, knee active range of motion symmetry, knee extensor strength symmetry, FTSST time, 6-minute walk test distance, and Stair Climbing Test time.
Results: Compared with preoperative values, the TKA group showed greater WB asymmetry at 1 month after surgery (P<.001). By 6 months, the TKA group had less WB asymmetry than preoperative values (P<.001), which was not different from the CTL group. Symmetry in WB correlated with functional outcomes and symmetry of quadriceps strength for the TKA group 6 months postoperatively.
Conclusions: Patients with unilateral knee OA showed WB asymmetry during sit-stand transitions early after unilateral TKA that improved by 6 months after surgery and was no different from that for healthy people of similar age. For people in the first 6 months after TKA, greater symmetry was related to better function and strength symmetry.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new method for the synthesis of spatial mechanism. Using harmonic analysis, the coupler curve and output angle function of spatial mechanism can be described as a series of harmonic characteristic component. For the path generation problem of the spatial mechanism, a technique of normalization processing eliminates the effects of scale, translation, and rotation; in other words, the harmonic characteristic component of the coupler curve is just determined by the basic dimensional type of spatial mechanism but not by the real dimension and the installing position. The numerical atlas database of coupler curve or output angle function of spatial mechanism can be created by the harmonic characteristic components and associated basic dimensional type of spatial mechanism. The best suitable basic dimensional type of spatial mechanism for prescribed function can be decided by using fuzzy identification method and numerical atlas database. On the basis of the basic dimensional type and formulas, which compute the coupler point, true size, and installing dimensions of the spatial mechanism, the dimension synthesis of the spatial mechanism is made possible. This paper takes the RSSR mechanism and RRSS mechanism as an example to illustrate the analysis process and application of this method. [DOI:10.1115/1.4001774]},

Our key ideas are two topics. The first topic is combination of standing assistance function and walking assistance function. In previous works, many assistance devices are specialized in only "standing-up operation" or "walking operation". However, in their daily life, elderly person needs standing, walking and seating assistance continuously by a same device. Our developing assistance system can support both operations by a small sized mechanism with low cost for domestic use. The second topic is steady standing assistance operation using an assistance manipulator and an active walker. In order to use the remaining physical strength of the patient, it is required to maintain the patient's body posture which enables him to use own strength easily. According to the patient's posture during standing up, our proposed system selects more appropriate device and controller, and realizes the standing assistance with steady posture of the patient based on the nursing specialists. The performance of our proposed system is verified by experiments using our prototype.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work is to obtain reliable kinematic measures relative to the execution of the Sit-to-Stand functional evaluation test, by low-cost and widely diffused instrumentation, that even non-experienced users can adopt in non-structured environments, like ambulatory or domestic settings. In particular, the paper refers to a low cost RGB-Depth sensor widely used in the gaming scenario like the Microsoft Kinect sensor. An algorithm is proposed that allows a reliable measure of human motion in a sagittal view. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to other two classic commercial algorithms. Results obtained by all the three algorithms have been compared to kinematic results obtained by the use of a stereophotogrammetric system that represents the gold-standard for kinematic measurement of human movement. Average errors of about 4 degrees, both for the trunk/leg angle and for the knee flexion/extension angle, have been obtained by the proposed algorithm and open the way to its possible adoption in non-clinical environments and further applications.},

We extend our frame work to a more general case where some part of the first input Curve can be aligned with some part of the second input Curve. This is a more difficult problem that we solve in O(N(3)) time. The contributions of the paper are the new Signature as well as faster algorithms for matching open 2D curves. We present examples from diverse application set to show that our algorithm can work across several domains. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, this longitudinal study aims to describe kinematic characteristics of the STS movement in children from 12 to 18 months, and also to investigate the relationship between changes in STS movement and childrens' daily-life mobility. Ten healthy children were evaluated at 12, 13, 14, 15 and 18 months of age. A motion analysis system was used to measure total duration of STS movement and angular movements of each joint, and frequencies of successful and unsupported STS were obtained. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory was used to assess childrens' daily-life mobility. Results showed that children tend to increase the frequency of successful trials over the months by reducing the total duration and decreasing peak ankle dorsiflexion and trunk flexion during STS. Children also started to stand up from chair with decreased trunk flexion angle among ages. At the end of the STS, we observed decreases in trunk flexion and knee flexion over age. Furthermore, kinematic characteristics that reflect improvements in STS movement are related to better performance of functional skills and decreased level of assistance provided by the caregiver in daily-life mobility of younger children. However, the strength of these associations decreases from 14 months of age onwards. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Healthy adults (n = 140) were recruited from the general population. Free-living activity for each participant was reported using an activity monitor. On average, participants performed 60 (+/-22) sit to stand movements each day. Participants in indoor sedentary occupations performed significantly more sit to stand movements per day than participants in outdoor active occupations (66 vs. 54; n = 102: p = 0.003). Participants (n = 33) performed significantly more sit to stand movements on working days than on non-working days (65 vs. 55; p = 0.018).
This analysis provides contemporary data for sit to stand frequency in a predominantly working population, and demonstrates that work and employment have a significant effect on that frequency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Many algorithms have been proposed for this so-called hand-eye calibration, but they do not treat the relative position and orientation in a unified way In this paper we introduce the use of dual quaternions, which are the algebraic counterpart of screws. Then we show how a line transformation can be written with the dual-quaternion product. We algebraically prove that if we consider the camera and motor transformations as screws, then only the line coefficients of the screw axes are relevant regarding the hand-eye calibration. The dual-quaternion parameterization facilitates a new simultaneous solution for the hand-eye rotation and translation using the singular value decomposition. Real-world performance is assessed directly in the application of hand-eye information for stereo reconstruction, as well as in the positioning of cameras. Both real and synthetic experiments show the superiority of the approach over two other proposed methods.},

   abstract = {Quadriceps weakness is prevalent with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To compensate for quadriceps dysfunction, patients often alter movement strategies. Little is known about muscle coordination during sit-to-stand (concentric) and stand-to-sit (eccentric) movements in the acute postoperative period. This investigation characterized the distribution of muscle activation between the concentric and eccentric phases during a five-time-sit-to-stand (FTSTS) movement in late stage OA and one month after TKA. Patients and healthy participants performed a FTSTS while recording bilateral ground reaction forces (GRFs) and electromyography (EMG). Concentric and eccentric ensemble averages of the GRF and EMG were calculated for the concentric and eccentric phases. Coactivation indices, integrated EMG, and GRF were calculated for each limb and phase. Patients demonstrated higher eccentric coactivation than the healthy group. Postoperative loading was higher in the nonsurgical limb. Postoperative quadriceps activity was lower in the concentric phase and higher in the eccentric phase than the healthy group. Higher coactivation in the patients resulted from sustained distribution of quadriceps activity throughout the eccentric phase. This indicated an inability to coordinate muscle firing when rapidly lowering to a chair and occurred despite unloading of the surgical limb. Although these patterns may serve as a protective strategy, they may also impede recovery of muscle function after TKA. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Fourteen children with CP and fourteen typically developing controls were recruited. Based on the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) the children with CP were divided into ICP (level I) and SCP (levels II and III). Balance was assessed using the Pediatric Balance Scale. Motor function was rated using the GMFCS. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded and analyzed during the STS task at two different seat heights and foot placement positions. The SCP exhibited significantly less balance according to the PBS and smaller displacement of their center of pressure (COP) in anteroposterior (COPAP) and mediolateral (COPML) direction relative to the other two groups. ICP demonstrated significant greater in the COPML displacement than the other groups. Children with CP required more time to complete the STS than controls. Those in the SCP group had lower linear displacement of the shoulder and knee than others during the STS task. During the high bench condition, the linear displacements of the shoulder and knee were reduced also. We conclude that the SCP has less COPAP and COPML oscillation, what means the better postural control during STS than the other two groups, which may be related to the support provided. The ICP exhibited greater COPML oscillations than controls, suggesting that they utilized different strategies in the frontal plane during the STS task. The seat height and foot placement did not influence postural control in children with CP, at least in terms of kinetic parameters. Seat height influenced the kinematic variables, with a high bench reducing linear displacement of the shoulder (vertical and horizontal) and knee (vertical) both in children with CP and control children.

If the trunk is partially restricted, different behavior of torques and muscle activities could be found and it can serve as a reference of the deterioration in the motor performance of subjects with PD. Fifteen subjects participated in this study and electromyography (EMG) activity of the tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SO), vastus medialis oblique (VMO), biceps femoris (BF) and erector spinae (ES) were recorded and biomechanical variables were calculated during four phases of the movement. Subjects with PD showed more flexion at the ankle, knee and hip joints and increased knee and hip joint torques in comparison to healthy subjects in the final position. However, these joint torques can be explained by the differences in kinematic data. Also, the hip, knee and ankle joint torques were not different in the acceleration phase of movement. The use of a partially restricted sit-to-stand task in PD subjects with moderate involvement leads to the generation of joint torques similar to healthy subjects. This may have important implications for rehabilitation training in PD subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The height of a chair seat affects the burden on the lower limbs during the sit-to-stand (STS). To develop an objective test to evaluate muscle function of the lower limbs using floor reaction force during a STS, the relationship between chair-seat height and the burden on the lower legs must be assessed. To examine the influence of the chair-seat height, floor reaction forces during a STS performed with 5 chair heights adjusted to each subject's lower leg length were compared. The force production and quickness of movement tended to decrease in the phases of trunk flexion and knee and hip joint extension when performing a STS from a lower chair, when the chair height differed by 20% (6.2 cm) from the lower leg length, and was marked when the difference between chair height and lower leg length became larger. In 52 elderly and 50 young adults, floor reaction forces during a STS performed from a chair of the same height as subjects' lower leg lengths were compared. Elderly persons were inferior in force production (strength) and quickness of movement, which decreased as elderly stood up from a chair of a lower height.},

   note = {10.1115/1.4037801},
   abstract = {The classic Burmester problem is concerned with computing dimensions of planar four-bar linkages consisting of all revolute joints for five-pose problems. We define extended Burmester problem as the one where all types of planar four-bars consisting of dyads of type RR, PR, RP, or PP and their dimensions need to be computed for n-geometric-constraints, where a geometric constraint is an algebraically expressed constraint on the pose, pivots, or something equivalent. In addition, we extend it to linear, non-linear, exact and approximate constraints. This extension also includes the problems when there is no solution to the classic Burmester problem, but designers would still like to design a four-bar that may come closest to capturing their intent. Machine designers often grapple with such problems while designing linkage systems where the constraints are of different varieties and usually imprecise. In this paper, we present 1) a unified approach for solving the extended Burmester problem by showing that all linear- and non-linear constraints can be handled in a unified way without resorting to special cases, 2) in the event of no or unsatisfactory solutions to the synthesis problem certain constraints can be relaxed, and 3) such constraints can be approximately satisfied by minimizing the algebraic fitting error using Lagrange Multiplier method. We present a new algorithm, which solves new problems including optimal approximate synthesis of Burmester problem with no exact solutions.},

   abstract = {It has been shown that thigh-seat contact-surface influences performance of isometric push-force with upper-limbs. The push-force performance is higher when subjects are seated with partial ischiofemoral / seat contact than when they are seated with full ischio-femoral contact. This was ascribed to greater pelvis and spine mobility induced by the short thigh-seat contact-surface. The present study tested the generalization of this hypothesis during movements involving body segment displacement, namely trunk flexion (TF) and sit-to-stand (STS) motor tasks. Both motor tasks were carried out in similar conditions to those implemented in the isometric push-force tasks, i.e. full ischio-femoral / seat contact (100-IFC) and short ischio-femoral contact (30-IFC, i.e. 30% of full ischio-femoral / seat contact).
Results showed that kinematic performances (maximal antero-posterior and vertical center of mass velocity and maximal backward displacement of center of pressure) in both motor tasks were higher in 30-IFC than in 100-IFC. In the sit-to-stand task, time of seat-off is shorter in 30-IFC. As the subject's initial global posture was comparable across the experimental conditions, it can be discarded as a source of performance change. It is discussed that it is the enhanced pelvis mobility induced by the sitting condition which is responsible for the increase of motor performance in both trunk flexion and sit-to-stand tasks. Our results highlight the role of joint mobility in motor performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Tri-axial accelerometers were secured to the sternum and anterior thigh of each participant during the assessment.

Differences between fallers and non-fallers were examined for each parameter.

These results suggest that each of these derived parameters would provide improved discrimination of fallers from non-fallers, for the cohort examined, than the standard clinical measure - the total time to complete the assessment.

Clinically, the time taken to complete the task is recorded with longer times indicating increased falls risk. Quantifying the movement using tri-axial accelerometers may provide a more objective and potentially more accurate falls risk estimate. 39 older adults, 19 with a history of falls, performed four repetitions of the FTSS in their homes. A tri-axial accelerometer was attached to the lateral thigh and used to identify each sit-stand-sit phase and sit-stand and stand-sit transitions. A second tri-axial accelerometer, attached to the sternum, captured torso acceleration. The mean and variation of the root-mean-squared amplitude, jerk and spectral edge frequency of the acceleration during each section of the assessment were examined. The test-retest reliability of each feature was examined using intra-class correlation analysis, ICC(2,k). A model was developed to classify participants according to falls status. Only features with ICC > 0.7 were considered during feature selection. Sequential forward feature selection within leave-one-out cross-validation resulted in a model including four reliable accelerometer-derived features, providing 74.4% classification accuracy, 80.0% specificity and 68.7% sensitivity. An alternative model using FTSS time alone resulted in significantly reduced classification performance. Results suggest that the described methodology could provide a robust and accurate falls risk assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is unknown if people living with dementia use the same strategies as other older adults and if a table positioned in front alters their performance. Twenty participants 65 years or older (10 with Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia; 10 without dementia) performed six STS trials from a standard chair with armrests, including three trials without and three with a table in front. Trials were digitally recorded and the starting position and type and order of strategies used were rated by a blinded assessor. Starting position was similar between the groups. The most common strategy was leaning forward (119 out of 120 trials) while the least used was sliding forward (four out of 120 trials). People living with dementia used significantly more strategies (p = 0.037), pushed through the armrests more than older adults (p = 0.038) and moved feet backwards more frequently in trials without the table in front (p = 0.010). Presence of the table had no significant effect on STS performance of older adults (p > 0.317). Our results demonstrated that people living with dementia had a similar starting position but used more strategies to stand up, pushing through their arms more than older adults without dementia and moved their feet backwards more often when no table was in front. People living with dementia should be provided with chairs with armrests and space to move feet backwards. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The equations of motion for a rigid body whose position is defined by the eight dual quaternion coordinates are derived. Because a rigid body has six degrees of freedom, the use of dual quaternion coordinates requires two additional differential constraint equations. The result is a set of ten differential equations prescribing the movement of the body. Use of these equations is demonstrated through a planar example of a double pendulum},

   abstract = {In this study, two different strategies of rising from a chair were compared, using integrated biomechanical and electromyographic analyses. Nine healthy subjects were instructed to rise using two different strategies: natural sit-to-stand transfer (NSTS) and a sit-to-stand transfer with full flexion of the trunk (FSTS). Sagittal kinematics and ground reaction forces were registered. Muscle activity of nine muscles of the right leg were recorded by means of surface EMG. All signals were synchronized at seat-off. The results show that no differences occur between the kinematics of knee and ankle, whereas the hip flexion is, as expected, higher during FSTS. The higher moment about the knee during NSTS is shifted to proportionally higher moments about the hip and ankle during FSTS. It is mainly the differences in the EMG-levels of the biarticular hip and knee muscles which might explain the differences in net moment. These results are in accordance with a theory about a particular role of biarticular muscles. On the other hand, the shift from knee to ankle cannot be associated with a particular increase in activity of the biarticular m.gastrocnemius. It is hypothesized that about the ankle, control of stability is preferred over movement control. An important conclusion for rehabilitation medicine is that a lower net moment about the knee in FSTS does not automatically imply that this reduces the load on the knee extensors.},

   abstract = {Sit-to-stand (STS) movement is widely performed in daily life and an important pre requisite for acquisition of functional abilities. However, STS is a biomechanical demanding task which requires high levels of neuromuscular coordination, muscle strength and postural control. As children with cerebral palsy (CP) exhibit a series of impairments in body structures and functions, STS movement performance could be impaired in this population. Thus, this article aimed to review studies that had described how STS movement is performed by children with CP, the factors that influence it and the methodological procedures adopted in it analyses. A search was performed by one reviewer in relevant databases. In all, 12 articles were identified and 9 were selected for the present review. It was detected a large variation in sample characteristics and methodological issues among studies. In fact, standardization of the method applied to STS movement analysis is not fully established. With regard to STS performance, children with CP exhibited variations among them and also when compared with their typical peers. Moreover extrinsic factors appear to influence STS movement performance in these children and its manipulation could be incorporated into rehabilitation protocols. Moreover, the relationship between STS movement and functionality in reviewed articles was not reported. Therefore the review allowed to observe that STS movement has been under-explored in children with CP, with a lack of standardized methodologies and a not well established relationship between this movement and functionality. Thus, further studies about STS movement in CP are necessary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Seven spastic hemiplegic CP patients (8.0 +/- 2.2 years), classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System as land II, and 18 typical children.(8.4 +/- 2.3 years) participated in this study. Trunk, hips, knees, and ankles angles and temporal variables of STS movement were obtained by means of kinematics evaluation. Isokinetic evaluation was performed at 60 degrees/s in the concentric passive mode to measure knee extensors torque. Social participation was assessed by the Assessment of Life Habits for Children (LIFE-H) scale. Results showed that children with spastic hemiplegic CP have lower knee extensor torque in the affected limb and restriction in social participation in dimensions related with fine motor control and language skills when compared to their typical peers. Except for ankle excursion in frontal plane, and ankle excursion and range in transverse plane, patients were similar to typical children regarding the strategies adopted to perform the STS movement, as well as in the participation dimensions related with gross motor function. Moreover, we found a significant non-linear correlation between knee extensors torque and some lower limb and trunk angles for children with CP. Therefore, during evaluation and rehabilitation processes, impairments in body functions and structures should be related with how much they affect a child's ability to perform functional activities, so rehabilitation protocols could be focused on individual needs.

This paper presents a method for an early detection of the initiation of sit-to-stand (SiSt) posture transition that can be used in the control of the powered orthosis. Unlike the methods used in prosthetic devices that rely on surface electromyography (EMG), the proposed method uses only sensors embedded into the orthosis brace attached to the limb. The method was developed and validated using data from a human study with 10 individuals. Each human trial included different sets of sitting, standing and walking activities originating from various initial postures. Features from the sensor signal were extracted and aggregated in lagged epochs to incorporate the time history. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the feature set. The principal components were then used in a leave-one-out manner to train a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to perform early detection of the SiSt posture transition. The proposed method achieved the sensitivity of 100% and the specificity 92.94% of trials without false positives. The average detection time (DT) of 0.1341 +/- 0.3310 s following the start of transition demonstrated early recognition of the initiation of SiSt transition.},

   abstract = {Ideal prostheses are artificial limbs that permit physically impaired individuals freedom of movement and independence. Transfemoral prostheses have been drastically improved in the last two decades; however, despite advancements in technology and medicine, they are incapable of generating net power about joints to allow patients to regain their original mobility and improve their quality of life. From a biomechanics perspective, currently available devices assist patients by absorbing and dissipating energy and thus hinder them from achieving daily activities. Historically, one of the main challenges for powered medical assistive devices has been the actuation system that mimics the characteristics of the biological musculoskeletal system. A medical device must be light, small, and cosmetically appealing, but it must also generate forces and torques that are proportional to the individual's weight. For industrial applications, many forms of actuators have been developed, such as electrical motors and hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders. However, none of these actuators have been shown to be optimal for powered transfemoral prostheses. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are candidates for powering medical assistive devices. This study first conducts a comprehensive investigation of knee biomechanics The failure of existing PAMs to meet the actuation requirements for powered transfemoral prostheses is then demonstrated. Based on the determined size, weight, kinetic, and kinematic requirements of knee articulation, a PAM design is proposed and evaluated. The proposed PAM is experimentally validated to meet the biomechanical requirements of a human knee during walking, stair ascent, and sit-to-stand movement.},

   abstract = {Background. In hemiparetic individuals, sit-to-stand (STS) transfer is characterized by asymmetric weight-bearing and altered trunk kinematics that can be improved by positioning the affected foot behind the nonaffected one. Objective. To examine the influence of frontal trunk kinematics on medio-lateral displacements of the center of pressure (CP) during STS performed with the feet placed in 2 different positions, as well as relationships between these parameters, medio-lateral stability, and clinical scores of the participants. Methods. Eighteen patients with chronic stroke and 15 control individuals were evaluated during sit-to-stand transfers either in spontaneous foot position or with their affected or dominant foot placed behind, respectively. Medio-lateral CP, pelvis, and shoulder displacement were analyzed using 3D kinematic and kinetic data recordings of the whole task. Motor and sensory impairment, spasticity, muscle strength, and equilibrium were evaluated by standard scales. The possible time during which a participant could prevent a fall (minimal time-to-contact) was used as a stability index. Results. Spontaneously, the deviation of the CP of stroke participants paralleled the tilt of the trunk toward the nonaffected side, as early as the first third of the task. With the affected foot placed behind, trunk position did not differ from those of control participants who executed the transfer spontaneously. Hemiparetic participants were less stable than control participants. Placement of the feet had no significant effect on the stability of either group. Stability was strongly associated with better motor scores on the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment. Conclusions. In hemiparetic individuals, improving STS symmetry by positioning the affected foot behind the nonaffected one did not decrease medio-lateral stability, which was associated with the level of stroke-related motor impairments.},

   abstract = {People with severe degenerative conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), have been shown to have altered movement patterns during sit-to-stand. However it remains unclear whether such alterations exist in people with early OA, in the absence of pain. This study aimed to determine if a novel seat could be used to discriminate people with early OA compared with controls. The sit-to-stand task was performed by 20 people with early medial knee OA and 20 age and gender-matched control subjects, using an instrumented seat. OA subjects showed altered weight distribution in the transition phase from sit to stand, in that they placed more load through their unaffected side. Task duration was significantly longer for OA subjects, and ground reaction force integrals were significantly greater for both legs of OA subjects. OA subjects had significantly higher knee flexion and adduction moments in their unaffected compared with affected side. This study has demonstrated that a novel instrumented seat can be used to discriminate people with early medial knee OA during the sit-to-stand activity. These results may be relevant for early interventions to delay or prevent changes in muscle function of the affected limb as well as contralateral knee or hip osteoarthritis in these patients.

Objectives: To (1) determine intrarater and test-retest reliability of the Five times sit-to-stand test (FISTS) in Parkinson's disease (PD), (2) characterize FTSTS performance in PD at different disease stages, (3) determine predictors of FTSTS performance in PD, and (4) determine the utility of the FTSTS for discriminating between fallers and nonfallers with PD, identifying an appropriate cutoff score to delineate between these groups.
Design: Measurement study of community-dwelling individuals with idiopathic PD.
Setting: A medical school laboratory.
Participants: Participants (N=82) were recruited via population-based sampling. The final sample included 80 participants. Two were excluded because of exclusion criteria and an unrelated illness, respectively.
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures: FTSTS time (seconds) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BEST), Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction Quadriceps, 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), 6-minute walk, Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, and Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.
Results: Interrater and test-retest reliability for the FTSTS were high (intraclass correlation coefficients: .99 and .76, respectively). Mean FTSTS performance was 20.25+/-14.12 seconds. All mobility measures were significantly correlated with FTSTS (P<.01). The Mini-BEST and 9HPT together explained 53% of the variance in FTSTS. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined a cutoff of 16.0 seconds (sensitivity, .75; specificity, .68) for discriminating between fallers and nonfallers, with an area under the curve of .77.
Conclusions: The FTSTS is a quick, easily administered measure that is useful for gross determination of fall risk in individuals with PD.},

Methods: A randomized cross-over trial was conducted from January to April, 2012 at a business in Minneapolis. 28 (nine men, 26 full-time) sedentary office workers took part in a 4 week intervention period which included the use of SSDs to gradually replace 50% of sitting time with standing during the workday. Physical activity was the primary outcome. Mood, energy level, fatigue, appetite, dietary intake, and productivity were explored as secondary outcomes. Results: The intervention reduced sitting time at work by 21% (95% CI 18%-25%) and sedentary time by 4.8 min/work-hr (95% CI 4.1-5.4 min/work-hr). For a 40 h work-week, this translates into replacement of 8 h of sitting time with standing and sedentary time being reduced by 3.2 h. Activity level during non-work hours did not change. The intervention also increased overall sense of well-being, energy, decreased fatigue, had no impact on productivity, and reduced appetite and dietary intake. The workstations were popular with the participants. Conclusion: The SSD intervention was successful in increasing work-time activity level, without changing activity level during non-work hours.},

Furthermore, the paper presents an innovative method of imposing Grashof's law for generation of acceptable initial population to improve the optimization performance. In addition to the ICA, the paper implements the parallel simulated annealing approach for the cases of without and with prescribed timing.

   pages = {203-216},
   abstract = {The problem of curve matching appears in many application domains, like time series analysis, shape matching, speech recognition, and signature verification, among others. Curve matching has been studied extensively by computational geometers, and many measures of similarity have been examined, among them being the Frechet distance (sometimes referred in folklore as the "dog-man" distance).
A measure that is very closely related to the Frechet distance but has never been studied in a geometric context is the Dynamic Time Warping measure (DTW), first used in the context of speech recognition. This measure is ubiquitous across different domains, a surprising fact because notions of similarity usually vary significantly depending on the application. However, this measure suffers from some drawbacks, most importantly the fact that it is defined between sequences of points rather than curves. Thus, the way in which a curve is sampled to yield such a sequence can dramatically affect the quality of the result. Some attempts have been made to generalize the DTW to continuous domains, but the resulting algorithms have exponential complexity.
In this paper we propose similarity measures that attempt to capture the "spirit" of dynamic time warping while being defined over continuous domains, and present efficient algorithms for computing them. Our formulation leads to a very interesting connection with finding short paths in a combinatorial manifold defined on the input chains, and in a deeper sense relates to the way light travels in a medium of variable refractivity.},

   abstract = {A common need in machine vision is to compute the 3-D rigid body transformation that aligns two sets of points for which correspondence is known. A comparative analysis is presented here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which computes the translational and rotational components of the transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the transformation representation used and the mathematical derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard [R, T] representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform. This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to degenerate data sets, and (3) relative computation time of each approach under different conditions. The results indicate that under ''ideal'' data conditions (no noise) certain distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for ''typical, real world'' noise levels, there is no difference in the robustness of the final solutions (contrary to certain previously published results). Efficiency, in terms of execution time, is found to be highly dependent on the computer system setup.},

Biomechanical features of STS have been investigated in patients with OA, but not in patients with early stage hip OA. The purpose of this study was to explore inter-limb weight-bearing asymmetries (WBA) and selected kinematic and kinetic variables during STS in patients with mild-to-moderate hip OA compared with healthy controls. Twenty-one hip OA patients and 23 controls were included in the study. Sagittal and frontal plane kinematic and kinetic data were collected using an eight-camera motion analysis system synchronized with two force plates embedded in the floor. There were no distinctive biomechanical alterations in sagittal or frontal plane kinematics or kinetics, movement time, or time to reach peak ground reaction force (GRF) in hip OA patients compared with controls. However, the hip OA patients revealed a distinct pattern of WBA compared with the controls, in unloading their involved limb by 18.4% at peak GRF. These findings indicate that patients with early stage hip OA are not yet forced into a stereotypical movement strategy for STS; however, the observed pattern of WBA requires clinical attention.

   abstract = {Background: Accidental falls remain an important problem in older people. The five-times-sit-to-stand (5STS) test is commonly used as a functional test to assess fall risk. Recent advances in sensor technologies hold great promise for more objective and accurate assessments. Objective: The aims of this study were: (1) to examine the feasibility of a low-cost and portable Kinect-based 5STS test to discriminate between fallers and nonfallers and (2) to investigate whether this test can be used for supervised clinical, supervised and unsupervised in-home fall risk assessments. Methods: A total of 94 community-dwelling older adults were assessed by the Kinect-based 5STS test in the laboratory and 20 participants were tested in their own homes. An algorithm was developed to automatically calculate timing- and speed-related measurements from the Kinect-based sensor data to discriminate between fallers and nonfallers. The associations of these measurements with standard clinical fall risk tests and the results of supervised and unsupervised in-home assessments were examined. Results: Fallers were significantly slower than nonfallers on Kinect-based measures. The mean velocity of the sit-to-stand transitions discriminated well between the fallers and nonfallers based on 12-month retrospective fall data. The Kinect-based measures collected in the laboratory correlated strongly with those collected in the supervised (r = 0.704-0.832) and unsupervised (r = 0.775-0.931) in-home assessments. Conclusion: In summary, we found that the Kinect-based 5STS test discriminated well between the fallers and nonfallers and was feasible to administer in clinical and supervised in-home settings. This test may be useful in clinical settings for identifying high-risk fallers for further intervention or for regular in-home assessments in the future. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Although STS movement has not been extensively applied to the study of knee osteoarthritis, it can provide relevant information about the effect of osteoarthritis on knee joint function. Two waveforms, knee flexion angle and flexion moment, were analysed simultaneously. Instead of using the common multivariate approach we used the functional one, which allows working with continuous functions with neither discretization nor time-scale normalization. The results show that time-scale normalization can alter the FPCA solution. Furthermore, FPCA presents better discriminatory power compared with the classical multivariate approach. This technique can, therefore, be applied as a functional assessment tool, allowing the identification of relevant variables to discriminate heterogeneous groups such as healthy and pathological subjects.},

This study was conducted to determine to what extent knee extension force (KEF) could explain independence in sit-to-stand (STS) performance from a standard chair. Subjects and Methods. This was a descriptive and correlational study of patients receiving acute rehabilitation (N = 107). Measurements of KEF of both lower extremities were obtained using manual muscle testing (MMT) and hand-held dynamometers (HHDs). The HHD measurements were normalized based on body weight and age- and sex-specific reference values. Measurements of the ability to stand without using the upper extremities (STS [without hands]) and to stand using the upper extremities (STS [with hands]) were correlated with the force measurements. Results. The correlations (r) of the KEF measurements with STS success ranged from .652 to .708 for STS (without hands) and from .545 to .638 for STS (with hands). Body weight added to the explanation, of STS (without hands) (R = .662) and STS (with hands) (R = .584) provided by KEF measured-by HHD. The receiver operating characteristic curves showed that HHD (weight normalized) was the most sensitive and specific measure for explaining independence in STS. Discussion and Conclusion. Manual and dynamometric measurements of KEF are related to independence in STS. Measurements of KEF quantified with a dynamometer and normalized against body weight provided the most valid, specific, and sensitive cutoff point for explaining STS independence.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose
Unlike gait analysis, no commonly accepted method for studying sit-to-stand (STS) movements exists. Most previous studies describing STS events used various methods to identify movement events while restricting sitting positions and movements. The present study observed natural rising from a sitting position using a simple method for measuring this common task. The purposes of this study were to compare commonly performed STS movements and to propose a standard system for defining identifiable sequential events.
Subjects and Methods
Ground reaction forces of 100 adults who were healthy (50 male, 50 female) were recorded using a force platform as each participant performed 4 methods of rising from sitting on a standard chair. The 4 STS conditions were: with arms free, with hands on knees, using armrests, and with arms crossed.
Results
For each subject, 11 recorded events from the vertical, fore-aft, and lateral dimensions were identified for all arm-use conditions. The only significant and clinically relevant force difference among ann-use conditions was that the armrests condition produced less average force than the other 3 conditions during the seat-off and vertical peak force events. Among average event times, the armrests condition showed significantly longer time to the vertical peak force event than the other conditions.
Discussion and Conclusion
Because these events occurred invariably in sequential order for every individual for all arm-use conditions in a relatively large sample of observations during natural STS movements, this method may be useful for establishing a standard method to assess and compare patient functionality and allow comparisons among STS research studies.},

   abstract = {In this paper we show that the Clifford Algebra of four dimensional Euclidean space yields a set of hypercomplex numbers called "double quaternions." Interpolation formulas developed to generate Bezier-style quaternion curves are shown to be applicable to double quaternions by simply interpolating the components separately. The resulting double quaternion curves are independent of the coordinate frame in which the key frames are specified Double quaternions represent rotations in E-4 which we use to approximate spatial displacements. The result is a spatial motion interpolation methodology that is coordinate frame invariant to a desired degree of accuracy within a bounded region of three dimensional space. Examples demonstrate the application of this theory to computing distances between spatial displacement, determining the mid-point between two displacements, and generating the spatial motion interpolating a set of key frames.},

   abstract = {Though it may be tempting to smooth orientation data by filtering the Euler angles directly, it is noted that smoothed Euler angles do not necessarily yield a smooth motion. This is caused by the difference between the metric in the rotation group and that in the Euclidean space. The quaternions, which Hamilton discovered in 1853, provide a means for representing rotation. A unit quaternion, represented as a hypersphere in R-4, has the same local topology and geometry as the rotation group. It thus provides a means for interpolating orientations. It is possible to achieve smooth rotation by filtering in quaternions the resulting quaternion may no longer be unitized. Fortunately, a unit quaternion curve, which represents the rotation path, can be derived by integrating the exponential map of the angular velocity. Unity of quaternions is thus maintained by filtering angular velocities. A lowpass filter coupled with an adaptive, mediative filter are employed to achieve smooth rotation motion in real time (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The hodographs of such curves correspond to certain combinations of four polynomials, given by Dietz et al. [4], that admit compact descriptions in terms of quaternions - an instance of the "PH representation map" proposed by Choi et al. [2]. The lowest-order PH curves that interpolate arbitrary first-order spatial Hermite data are quintics. It is shown that, with PH quintics, the quaternion representation yields a reduction of the Hermite interpolation problem to three "simple" quadratic equations in three quaternion unknowns. This system admits a closed-form solution, expressing all PH quintic interpolants to given spatial Hermite data as a two-parameter family. An integral shape measure is invoked to fix these two free parameters.},

   abstract = {An adapted frame (t, u, v) on a space curve r(xi) is a right-handed set of three orthonormal vectors, where t is the unit tangent and u, v span the curve normal plane. For such frames to have a rational dependence on the curve parameter, r(xi) must be a Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve, since only PH curves have rational unit tangent vectors. Among all possible adapted frames, the rotation-minimizing frame (RMF) is the most attractive for applications such as animation, swept surface constructions, and motion planning. The PH curves admit exact RMF descriptions, but they involve transcendental (logarithmic) functions. Since rational forms are generally preferred, the problem of rational approximation of RMFs for PH curves is considered herein. This is accomplished by employing the Euler-Rodrigues frame (ERF) as a reference (the ERF is rational and, unlike the Frenet frame, does not suffer indeterminacies at inflections). The function that describes the angular deviation between the RMF and ERF is derived in closed form, and is approximated by Pade (rational Hermite) interpolation. In typical cases, these interpolants furnish compact approximations of excellent accuracy, amenable to use in a variety of applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {After unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA), rehabilitation specialists often constrain knee angles or foot positions during sit-to-stand, to encourage increased weight bearing through the operated limb. Biomechanical studies often constrain limb position during sit-to-stand in an effort to reduce variability. Differences between self-selecting or constraining position are unknown in persons after TKA. Twenty-six subjects with unilateral TKA participated in motion analysis. Subjects performed the sit-to-stand using a self-selected position (ssSTS); next, trials were collected in a constrained condition (ccSTS), where both knees were positioned with the tibia vertical, perpendicular to the floor. Repeated measures ANOVA (limb x condition) assessed differences between limbs and between conditions. Subjects used greater hip flexion bilaterally during ccSTS (91 degrees) compared to ssSTS (87 degrees; p = 0.001) and knee flexion on the non-operated limb was greater during ssSTS (84 degrees) compared to ccSTS (82 degrees; p = 0.018). The ccSTS resulted in larger extensor moments on the non-operated limb at the hip (ssSTS -0.473, ccSTS -0.521; p = 0.021) and knee (ssSTS -0.431, ccSTS -0.457; p = 0.001) compared to the operated limb. The ccSTS exacerbated the asymmetries at the hip and knee compared to ssSTS, and did not improve use of the operated limb. Reliance on the non-operated limb may put them at risk for progression of osteoarthritis in other joints of the lower extremities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose. Following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), quadriceps femoris muscle strength (force-generating capacity) and functional test scores improve but continue to be lower than those in people without injury. Analysis of the sit-to-stand (STS) task demonstrated side-to-side differences in subjects with TKA, as well as differences between subjects with TKA and control subjects. It was hypothesized that, when using a self-selected starting position, subjects I year following TKA would show improvements in strength and movement patterns but would continue to show asymmetries of angles and moments at the hips and knees.
Subjects and Methods. Twenty-four subjects (12 subjects with unilateral TKA and 12 control subjects) were recruited; those with TKA were tested 3 months and I year following surgery. Motion analysis of an STS task was synchronized with 2 force platforms and electromyography. Outcome measures included joint angles and moments, electromyography, vertical ground reaction forces, muscle strength, and functional performance tests.
Results. Subjects with TKA showed improvements in symmetry of motion, strength, and functional performance from 3 months to I year following TKA. Compared with control subjects, subjects with TKA relied on increased hip flexion and a larger hip extensor moment to perform the STS task.
Discussion and Conclusion. The increased hip extensor moment demonstrated that subjects adopted a strategy to avoid the use of the quadriceps femoris muscle, yet this strategy persisted as quadriceps femoris muscle strength improved. This pattern may be a learned movement pattern that may not resolve without retraining.},

Animals-10 healthy adult Labrador Retrievers.
Procedures-10 dogs were filmed during walk and sit-to-stand motions. Five trials were recorded for each dog, 3 of which were digitized. Two observers manually marked 15 landmarks on each frame during the motions of interest for these 3 trials. Each observer repeated the procedure approximately 1 week later. The 2-D joint angles were calculated. Intra- and interobserver coefficients of multiple correlations (CMCs) were calculated for each joint angle-time history.
Results-Intraolbserver repeatability, assessed as the mean CMCs of 12 joint angle measurements made for 10 dogs by 2 observers, was good or excellent in 23 of 24 (96%) mean CMCs of the joints measured. Interobserver variation, assessed by comparing CMCs of measurements made by 2 observers on 10 dogs on 2 days, was good or excellent in 161 of 240 (67%) CMCs of joints measured.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Intraobserver repeatability of 2-D kinematic measurements made on digitized videotapes was excellent. Interobserver repeatability of these measurements was acceptable.},

   abstract = {Objective: To observe the differences in performance variables of the sit to stand transfer ( as measured on the NeuroCom Balance Master) in a population of senior athletes.
Method: A convenience sample of 173 subjects aged 50 years and older. Data were obtained from voluntary participation in a health fair offered at the annual Huntsman World Senior Games in St George, Utah, USA. All sit to stand tests were performed on the NeuroCom Balance Master. The measured parameters were weight transfer time (WTT), rising power ( force exerted to rise), and centre of gravity sway ( COG sway) during the rising phase.
Results: A significant difference was found between stratified age groups ( 50 - 64 and 65+ years) on rising power. There was also a sex difference in rising power. No significant differences were found in weight transfer time or COG sway.
Conclusion: While rising power decreases with increasing age in senior athletes, WTT and COG sway remain similar regardless of age or sex. The maintenance of these other two variables ( WTT and COG sway) may be attributable to physical activity and/or participation in sport.},

   abstract = {Postural control deficits are the most disabling aspects of Parkinson's disease (PD), resulting in decreased mobility and functional independence. The aim of this study was to assess the postural control stability, revealed by variables based on the centre of pressure (Cop), in individuals with PD while performing a sit-to-stand-to-sit sequence under single- and dual-task conditions.
An observational, analytical and cross-sectional study was performed. The sample consisted of 9 individuals with PD and 9 healthy controls. A force platform was used to measure the CoP displacement and velocity during the sit-to-stand-to-sit sequence. The results were statistically analysed.
Individuals with PD required greater durations for the sit-to-stand-to-sit sequence than the controls (p < 0.05). The anteroposterior and mediolateral CoP displacement were higher in the individuals with PD (p < 0.05). However, only the anteroposterior CoP velocity in the stand-to-sit phase (p = 0.006) was lower in the same individuals. Comparing the single- and dual-task conditions in both groups, the duration, the anteroposterior CoP displacement and velocity were higher in the dual-task condition (p < 0.05).
The individuals with PD presented reduced postural control stability during the sit-to-stand-to-sit sequence, especially when under the dual-task condition. These individuals have deficits not only in motor performance, but also in cognitive performance when performing the sit-to-stand-to-sit sequence in their daily life tasks. Moreover, both deficits tend to be intensified when two tasks are performed simultaneously. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Objective. The aim of this study was to describe the sagittal thoracolumbar kinematics and hip-lumbar interaction during the STS task in elderly people who were healthy in order to guide physical therapists in developing treatment strategies.
Design. This was an observational study.
Methods. Ten retroreflective markers were attached to the midline thoracolumbar spine, pelvis, and right lower limb of 41 elderly people who were healthy. A 2-dimensional video analysis system was used to measure sagittal thoracic, lumbar, hip, and knee joint angles during the STS task. Maximal available flexion-extension angles in these joints and regions also were determined.
Results. Prior to buttocks lift-off, forward trunk lean comprised concurrent hip and lumbar flexion and thoracic extension. Hip flexion dominated, with a hip/lumbar ratio of 4.7:1 and a thoracic/lumbar ratio of 1.7:1. The hip and lumbar spine contributed 90% and 23% of their maximal available flexion angle, respectively, and the thoracic spine contributed 86% of its maximal extension range of movement. After lift-off, the hips and lumbar spine extended (ratio of 5.2:1), and the thoracic spine flexed (thoracic/lumbar ratio of 0.4:1). At lift-off, the hips and knees were similarly flexed (96) and then locked together in a linear pattern of extension. Following lift-off, there was a brief transition phase (5% of STS duration) in which, although the hips, knees, and lumbar spine were extending, the trunk continued to flex forward a few degrees.
Limitations. Results may differ in elderly people who are less active.
Conclusions. The revised model for image-based analysis demonstrated concurrent hip and thoracolumbar movement during the STS task. Close to full available hip flexion and thoracic extension were needed for optimal STS performance.},

Problems of patients with PD in sit-to-stand (STS) performance have been verified before, but not the effects of training on biomechanical measures of STS function. This pilot study aimed to analyse effects of 12 weeks of Nordic Walking training and severity of PD: healthy controls (CO), least (UPDRS A) and more severe (UPDRS B) affected PA on selected functional outcome measures. We expected improvements in PD similar to CO, with better performance of the unstable second phase and faster execution of the entire movement with higher velocities of centre of gravity (COG).
3D kinematics of 22 PD and 18 CO subjects before and after training, were recorded using a motion analysis system (Vicon, Oxford). We compared five outcome measures for STS in 11 PD and 11 CO, matched according to age, gender, height, and weight. Effects of Nordic Walking training were not statistically significant but indicated different patterns which depended on the values of patient's UPDRS score (part III, motor functions). Time required for STS performance increased and horizontal and vertical velocity of COG decreased in UPDRS B, which could be due to progression of PD during the training period. In contrast, UPDRS A showed similar effects as CO. The effects of Nordic Walking as an easy, economic and low-risk intervention on STS in PD depend on the degree of PD. Our findings may help scientists, patients, and therapists to adjust sport-physiological interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Sit-to-stand (STS) is a crucial transfer influencing a person's independence in daily activities, as well as safety and quality of life, and is thus vital to evaluate in research and in practice. Clinical STS tests provide single values in seconds or numbers of STS. There is, however, increasing numbers of research papers reporting spatial and temporal kinematic and kinetic process STS data.
Objectives: To provide an overview of research findings from laboratory-based movement analyses regarding phases and determinants of typical STS, characteristics of successful versus failed STS transfers, and finally STS performance in some neurological conditions.
Major Findings: The STS transfer, previously regarded as mainly requiring lower limb muscle strength, is increasingly recognized as a complex transfer skill. Muscle strength, balance, foot position, chair height and the movement strategy are major determinants influencing STS performance. Scaling and timing of momentum generation throughout STS seems critical for success or failure. Sit-to-stand in stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by asymmetry in force generation and difficulties in switching movement direction, respectively. In-depth, knowledge regarding mechanisms of momentum control during STS sub-phases, STS failures, as well as exploration of variability in normal and atypical STS is still lacking.
Conclusions: Recent research based on instrumented movement analyses has generated better understanding of movement control during STS, but the specifics are not yet reflected in clinical assessments. There seems to be a call for clinical tools capturing determinants and process characteristics of the STS transfer for a more comprehensive evaluation in rehabilitation.},

In addition, young subjects were asked to perform another block of trials with their trunk purposely bent forward prior to seat-off.

Young and elderly subjects utilized similar strategies but with different COM acceleration profiles to perform STS. Furthermore, data from an elderly subject who complained of difficulty in STS during the experiment were located outside the forward boundary of the ROSa, demonstrating a potential use of ROSa to differentiate individuals with declined balance control ability.

[Subjects] Nineteen male volunteers were included (age: 21 +/- 1 years). [Methods] The subjects moved from a sitting position to a standing position under two different foot placement conditions: (1) 0 degrees of dorsiflexion on the non-dominant side and 20 degrees of dorsiflexion on the dominant side (P1) and (2) 20 degrees of plantarflexion on the non-dominant side and 20 degrees of dorsiflexion on the dominant side (P2). Two standing conditions were used: (1) natural movement and (2) instructed movement, with instructions to increase weight bearing on the non-dominant side. The center of gravity trajectory and its jerk cost were calculated at each axis: front and back (jerk-x), right and left (jerk-y), and vertical (jerk-z). [Results] Jerk-x and jerk-y were significantly larger during instructed movement than natural movement in both P1 and P2. Jerk-z was not significantly different between instructed and natural movement in P1 or P2. [Conclusion] These results indicate that energy cost influences the formation of the center of gravity trajectory during sit-to-stand motion with asymmetrical foot placement.},

   abstract = {We study a problem of the geometric quantization for the quaternion projective space. First we explain a Kahler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle of the quaternion projective space, whose Kahler form coincides with the natural symplectic form on the cotangent bundle and show that the canonical line bundle of this complex structure is holomorphically trivial by explicitly constructing a nowhere vanishing holomorphic global section. Then we construct a Hilbert space consisting of a certain class of holomorphic functions on the punctured cotangent bundle by the method of pairing polarization and incidentally we construct an operator from this Hilbert space to the L 2 space of the quaternion projective space. Also we construct a similar operator between these two Hilbert spaces through the Hopf fiberation. We prove that these operators quantize the geodesic flow of the quaternion projective space to the one parameter group of the unitary Fourier integral operators generated by the square root of the Laplacian plus suitable constant. Finally we remark that the Hilbert space above has the reproducing kernel.},

Moreover, instead of the usual strategy of using Fourier coefficients, we propose a new method based on wavelet descriptors to represent the shape of the path, where the points do not need to be sampled at a constant time interval. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of this wavelet-based neural network over the Fourier-based network in finding the optimal mechanism. They also show the accuracy of the proposed approach in providing near optimal crank-rocker mechanism solutions for path generation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Rising from a chair or sit to stand (STS) is a movement with a great clinical interest: it is meaningful in order to evaluate motor control and stability in patients with functional limitations. STS requires some skills, as coordination between trunk and lower limbs movements, correction of muscles strength, control of equilibrium and stability and it is often considered into clinical evaluation scales of different pathologies. In literature, although some studies are focused on STS, the essential functions of standing up are not well standardized and uniformly defined: for this reason its application in clinical centres is difficult. In this study an experimental set-up for acquisition of STS movement which is suitable for clinical applications has been proposed: first, it was studied in healthy subjects, to define a normative database of this specific motor task, then in pathological subjects (adults with hemiplegia), to quantify their functional limitation, using quantitative kinematic and kinetic parameters. The results showed that this experimental set-up is effective both in healthy and in pathological subjects; some significant parameters were identified and calculated in order to characterise and quantify the functional limitation of patients.

The main aim of this work is to investigate the effect of muscular strengthening on sit-to-stand (STS) movement to get round the muscular weakness that often occur in elderly people.
The sit-to-stand movement of 18 young persons and 10 elderly healthy subjects were acquired before and after an electrical stimulation (ES) strengthening cycle.
Experimental data collected by using an optoelectronic system (ELITE), an EMG telemetric equipment and a force platform were analysed by using a biomechanical planar model. The rising strategies and hip knee and ankle joint torques in the two different groups were calculated before and after ES cycle.
The results showed that before ES the subjects, both young and elderly, used a strategy characterised by a fully trunk flexion in order to minimise the knee joint torque.
After ES cycle we observed a diminished trunk flexion subsequent to the lower limb muscular strengthening.
These data give a biomechanical analysis of the importance of joint torques strengths and postural stability in STS task and should be used to study the risk of falls in elderly.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, controlled (obese patients vs controls) study on sit-to-stand movement analysis
SUBJECTS: Ten adult young volunteers (five men and five women, mean age 28, s.d, 3 y; mean BMI 22, s.d. 2.3 kg/m(2)) and 30 obese subjects 25 women and five men, mean age 39.4, s.d. 13.7 y, mean BMI 40, s.d. 5.9 kg/m(2)) suffering from chronic lower back pain were analyzed in a sit-to-stand task (10 trials for each subject).
MEASUREMENTS: Angle parameters carried out from a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of sit-to-stand (STS) movement, using an optoelectronic system.
RESULTS: SIS task in controls was characterized by a fully forward bending strategy of the trunk, while in obese patients at the beginning (first trial) of the STS task they limited the forward bending in order to protect the vertebral column. When fatigue increased during the execution of multiple STS tasks, the protection of the vertebral column was secondary to the execution of the task. In order to limit the muscle fatigue they increased the forward bending in order to decrease knee joint torque.
DISCUSSION: The analysis of the strategy used by obese patients in STS tasle can be used in the design of future trials to assess the efficacy of rehabilitative treatment.},

Investigated parameters were transition's duration, range of trunk tilt, smoothness of transition pattern assessed by its fractal dimension, and trunk movement's dynamic described by local wavelet energy. A measurement protocol with a Si-St followed by a St-Si postural transition was performed by two groups of participants: the first group (N = 79) included Frail Elderly subjects admitted to a post-acute rehabilitation facility and the second group (N = 27) were healthy community-dwelling elderly persons. Subjects were also evaluated with Tinetti's POMA scale. Compared to Healthy Elderly persons, frail group at baseline had significantly longer Si-St (3.85 +/- 1.04 vs. 2.60 +/- 0.32, p = 0.001) and St-Si (4.08 +/- 1.21 vs. 2.81 +/- 0.36, p = 0.001) transition's duration. Frail older persons also had significantly decreased smoothness of Si-St transition pattern (1.36 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.21 +/- 0.05, p = 0.001) and dynamic of trunk movement. Measurements after three weeks of rehabilitation in frail older persons showed that smoothness of transition pattern had the highest improvement effect size (0.4) and discriminative performance. These results demonstrate the potential interest of such parameters to distinguish older subjects with different functional and health conditions. (C) 2011 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One male unilateral transfemoral amputee participated in the pilot study. The subject was instructed to rise in a comfortable and natural manner and conduct a series of sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit. We simultaneously measured kinematics, kinetics and muscle activities. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimension and identify modes and a convenient index of STS symmetry (slope of the major axis of the error ellipse) is proposed using the insole pressure sensors. Based on the preliminary results it is recommended that kinematics and kinetics in both the sagittal and frontal planes be considered for an AK amputee performing STS. The information might be useful for further research on amputee STS.},

Algebraic spherical motions and rational B-spline spherical motions are represented as algebraic curves and rational B-Spline curves in the space of quaternions (or the image space).

In the case of three dimensions a subset of the Clifford algebra also represents the group of spatial rigid displacements as a six-dimensional manifold in an eight-dimensional space R8. Thus, the set of relative positions of two parts are mapped to a manifold in R8. This manifold is a geometric representation of the functional constraint. In this paper we derive the manifolds for six spatial functional constraints that define quadric algebraic manifolds.

The first paper dealt with the problem of computing spatial displacements from a minimum number of simple features of points, lines, planes, and their combinations. The present paper deals with the same problem using a redundant set of the simple geometric features. The problem for redundant information is formulated as a least squares problem which includes all simple features. A Clifford algebra is used to unify the handling of various feature information. An algorithm for determining the best orientation is developed which involves finding the eigenvector associated with the least eigenvalue of a 4 x 4 symmetric matrix. The best translation is found to be a rational cubic function of the best orientation. Special cases are discussed which yield the best orientation in closed form. In addition, simple algorithms ave provided for automatic generation of body-fixed coordinate frames from various feature information. The results have applications in robot and world model calibration for off-line programming and computer vision.},

In particular, a rational Bezier representation for two-parameter freeform motions is developed. It has been shown that the trajectory surface of such a motion is a tenser-product rational Bezier surface and that such a kinematically generated surface has a geometric as well as a kinematic control structure. The results have not only theoretical interest in CAGD and kinematics but also applications in CAD/CAM and Robotics.},

An algorithm, based on a recursive formula, is given, which enables the user to decide whether a solution curve exists or not. In the first case the algorithm yields a parametrization of this curve. Finally we show the geometric invariance and the parameter invariance of these interpolation curves. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The motivation of this work is to design a compact standing mechanism to help an elderly/disabled person with functional limitation in lower extremities to maneuver in small and confined spaces and enable them to perform standard daily life routines independently. The wheelchair system at the upright standing position is tested with different travel distances, and the challenge is to control both sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit operations in a stable manner using flexible-joint humanoid. An additional spring/damping element is incorporated at each wheel to provide a comfortable ride for the user especially during stand-to-sit transformation task. A PD-fuzzy control with modular structure is implemented, and the performance of the system is observed through VISUAL NASTRAN 4D (VN4D) visualization software and simulation in MATLAB. The stand-to-sit performance tests have shown more than 38% reduction in tilt and back seat angles fluctuation in linear travel motion using a suspension system, while the initial tilt torque needed is 50% less than the amount required in previous designs.},

Individuals with SCI have successfully used FNS to stand, but the transition from sitting to standing is often awkward and may require excessive amounts of arm support. The long-term goal of this research project is to provide stimulation patterns that reduce the demands on an FNS user's arms and provide a smooth, stable sit-to-stand transition. A multi-segment, dynamic model has been developed to simulate different combinations of stimulated muscles and stimulation patterns. The model includes individualized anthropometric parameters, active and passive muscle and joint mechanics, and arm support forces (experimentally measured or an assumed pattern). Stimulated muscle properties were derived using SIMM software (Musculographics, Chicago, IL), and the simulations were run in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, NIA), Initial simulation results have estimated that ramped stimulation of the vastus lateralis and semimembranosus muscles reduces the peak vertical arm support forces from 91% to 42% of body weight as compared to unassisted sit-to-stand. Kinematic results also suggested that the hand support forces remained excessive due to a lack of joint coordination and insufficient ankle joint stiffness. In further simulations, additional muscles will be stimulated to increase joint stiffness and stimulation patterns will be designed to mimic able-bodied sit-to-stand motions. This model will be validated and improved using results of sit-to-stand experiments with FNS users once an optimized set of muscles and stimulation patterns has been determined.},

   abstract = {Sit-to-stand transfers are a fundamental activity of daily living, but it remains unknown how to systematically recommend a foot placement that matches an individual's physical capabilities. The first goal of this study was to measure biomechanical changes in sit-to-stand movements as a function of foot placement. The second goal was to develop a model that would optimize foot placement for ease of sit-to-stand and would determine challenging foot placements for strengthening. A female older adult who had undergone bilateral total knee replacement participated in the study. Video and force platform data were collected for sit-to-stand movements from foot-back, foot-neutral, right-staggered, and leftstaggered placements. The optimal foot placement was determined by minimizing the highest strength percentage for any single joint torque. Strength-challenging foot placements were found by maximizing the highest strength percentages for targeted joint torques. The right-staggered placement was optimal and had a limiting factor of left hip extension torque (strength percentage 74.7%). Maximum left hip extension torque (76.7 Nm) was similar to the maximum right hip extension torque (79.5 Nm) for this foot placement. The strength-challenging foot placement with the highest strength percentage was for left ankle plantar flexion torque (89.4%) and occurred while using the left-staggered placement. The optimal right-staggered foot placement for this older adult balanced the hip extension torques between the stronger, painful right side and the weaker, less painful left side. This model-based technique has the potential to allow clinicians to select foot placements that may enhance the functional independence of older adults with osteoarthritis.},

Three symmetric (foot-neutral, foot-back, and foot-intermediate) and three asymmetric foot placements (preferred stagger, nonpreferred stagger, and intermediate stagger) were tested. Standard (46 cm) and low (41 cm) seat heights were chosen to represent an average public seat height and a 10% lower seat height. Using inverse dynamics, maximum ankle plantarflexion, knee extension, hip extension, and hip abduction moments were calculated. Hip extension moments were significantly increased when using foot-neutral as compared to foot-back. Ankle plantarflexion and knee extension moments were significantly increased when a foot was placed in the posterior position as compared to the anterior position for preferred and nonpreferred stagger. Knee extension moments were significantly increased at the low seat height as compared to the standard seat height. When shifting the feet anterior or posterior for symmetric placements during sit-to-stand, the most dramatic effect was an increase in hip extension moments when the feet are shifted anteriorly. Utilizing asymmetric foot placements during sit-to-stand produced increases in ankle plantarflexion and knee extension moments for the posteriorly placed limb, with reductions in the anteriorly placed limb.

Design. A non-invasive laboratory study of human subjects.
Background. Normal strategies for sit-stand manoeuvres are modified in cases of chronic LBP. Subtle changes and many parameters are unsuitable for conventional statistics.
Methods. Fourteen healthy subjects, 16 chronic LBP patients, acid 12 subjects pretending to have LBP participated. Forces and centres of pressure at the feet and knees, plus hip and lumbar movements provided inputs into a three-layer feed-forward ANN with sigmoidal transfer functions. The ANN was trained with data from 35 of the 36 subjects, and its ability to classify the left-out subject was tested. This was repeated with each subject omitted from training in turn.
Results. The ANN correctly classified 31 of 36 subjects. The subjects were also classified by nine physiotherapists from videos of the manoeuvres. Their success rate was significantly lower that that of the ANN, which is not surprising for an unusual procedure without training.
Conclusions. ANNs should be considered as additional tools in assessment and possible diagnosis of pathological movements.
Relevance
The capacity of AN Ns to discriminate patterns of human movement offers a technique that may prove to be a useful tool for assessment and diagnosis. Copyright (C) 1996 Eisevier Science Ltd.},

The method implements the estimate of translation, rotation, and scaling by means of a maximum likelihood approach carried out in the Gauss-Laguerre transform domain. The approach is particularly suitable for human movement analysis in clinical contexts, where kinematics is at present performed by means of marker-based systems. Specific drawbacks of these latter systems, such as the burden of time for marker placement and the intrinsic intrusive nature, would be removed by the proposed method. Experimental results in terms of tracking performance are obtained by analyzing video sequences capturing the execution of the sit-to-stand task in two groups of young and elderly volunteers. The results are compared with clinical studies that used marker-based systems, and are particularly encouraging for a future extension of the approach to other motor tasks and to predict scores obtained from the physical performance batteries that are widely and regularly used by clinicians and physical therapists.},

One of the three error functions is an obvious choice, whereas the other two error functions are newly formulated making use of the basic theory of planar motion of a rigid body and motion generating four-bar mechanisms. The method of differential evolution is used to carry out the optimization for the three objective functions. Results for three problems are presented, all of which fall in the category of motion generation without prescribed timing. Results obtained using the three error functions are compared with regard to accuracy and computational time, on the basis of which conclusions are drawn regarding their relative performance.

Three different techniques will be used in modelling the wheelchair. SolidWorks (R) software package will be used in the initial stage in order to get an estimation of the necessary motor power. A second model of the system will be built using SimMechanics Matlab toolbox (R). In order to check the results obtained from both approaches; SolidWorks and SimMechanics, the model built designed by SolidWorks is embedded in SimMechanics where the system has been simulated for the third time. In all the three simulation stages; the system is considered to do a complete cycle of motion; sit-to-stand and a stand-to-sit. The system performance has been detected based on an open loop scenario where no control is implemented as this stage. Further analysis of the system has been done considering the energy consumption in two different modes; sit-to-stand mode and a forward straight line motion for a prescribed distance.},

The proposed work aims at developing a wheelchair with a mechanism that enables the wheelchair user to transform from sit to stand posture and vice versa. This configuration will allow the user to use the wheelchair as a mobility device as well as for rehabilitation purposes without need any external support. The main idea of this project is to allow blood circulation in the legs as sitting for long periods do not allow the blood to circulate normally through the legs and hence inflates the disability. This wheelchair also allows disabled people to stand, complete activities to equate them to normal people and make them capable of assisting themselves without the need of any help or feeling embarrassed. The special feature of this wheelchair is that it has to be of a low cost comparing to other wheelchairs with the same functionality.},

   abstract = {Rapid stepping is a common strategy employed by older adults to avoid falls. The relative contributions of dynamic balance, balance confidence and fear of falling to SET, was investigated in older adults. Thirty-three community-dwelling older adults completed tests of SET as well as the FTSST, a test of motor performance associated with dynamic balance. Psychological indicators of balance-related confidence assessed were the ABC 6-item scale (ABC-6) and fear of falling. Mean SET was significantly slower in the fear of falling group than in the no fear of falling group (p < 0.001). Correlational analysis indicated that poorer performance on the FTSST and lower balance confidence, were associated with slower time to execute a rapid step. A stepwise multiple regression model including the FTSST, ABC-6 score, and fear of falling as predictor variables, explained 58% of the variance in SET (p < 0.001). The FTSST explained the largest proportion of the variance in SET (36%), followed by fear of falling (15%) and ABC-6 score (7%). These data show that the FTSST, ABC-6 score and fear of falling are significant and independent predictors of SET in older adults. Dynamic balance, balance confidence and fear of falling, may play important roles in executing rapid steps in older adults. Motor performance and psychological indicators of balance-related confidence appear to have crucial roles in SET in older adults. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background and aims: The five-times-sit-to-stand test (FTSST) is a physical performance test commonly-used in clinical geriatric studies. The relationship between FTSST times and dynamic balance has not been widely investigated in older adults. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of the FTSST as a measure of dynamic balance in older adults. A second objective was to quantify relative and absolute reliability, as well as minimum detectable change (MDC) of the FTSST in older adults. Methods: Twenty-nine females (mean age, 73.6 years) performed two trials of the FTSST, timed up and go (TUG), and functional reach (FR) tests. Validity of the FTSST as a measure of dynamic balance was evaluated by quantifying strength of relationships between the FTSST and two measures of dynamic balance, TUG and FR, using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Measures of relative [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)] and absolute [standard error of measurement (SEM)] reliability, as well as the MDC at the 95% confidence level (MDC95) were computed for the FTSST. Results: The Pearson's correlation coefficient between FTSST and TUG (r=0.64, p<0.001) indicates that FTSST is a valid measure of dynamic balance and functional mobility in older adults. The ICC2,1 of 0.95 is indicative of excellent relative reliability of the FTSST. SEM was 0.9 seconds and MDC95 was 2.5 seconds for the FTSST. SEM (6.3% of mean FTSST) and MDC (17.5% of mean FTSST) percent values were low. Conclusions: The FTSST is a valid measure of dynamic balance and functional mobility in older adults. The high ICC and low SEM and SEM% suggest excellent relative and absolute reliability and reproducibility of the FTSST in older adults. Change in FTSST performance should exceed 2.5 seconds to be considered real change beyond measurement error. (C) 2012, Editrice Kurtis},

In relatively complex long duration motor tasks such as the sit-to-stand (STS) movement, the central nervous system commands have to take into account the inputs from muscle, skin, and joint afferents during muscle contraction. We have investigated the changes occurring in tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) motoneuronal excitability prior to and during the STS movement in normal subjects. Twelve healthy volunteers received the instruction to rise from a chair at the perception of an acoustic 'go' signal. Cortical transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) or peripheral nerve electrical stimuli (PNS) were used as test stimuli to elicit, respectively, the motor evoked potential (MEP) and the H reflex, at intervals of 50-1500 ms after the 'go' signal. Both the MEP and the H reflex were enhanced in the TA between 100 and 900 ms after the 'go' signal. At the same time there was inhibition of the H reflex but not of the MEP in the SOL. At the end of the STS movement, during quiet standing, the size of both the H reflex and the MEP of the TA were not different from those obtained in the sitting position. However, in SOL, the H reflex was smaller, and the MEP was larger, than at rest. Our observations suggest the participation of several mechanisms of control of motoneuronal excitability during the STS, ultimately leading to a dominant role of presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms in SOL during standing.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Postural activity is an essential part of any voluntary movement. In movements involving all body parts such as in the sit-to-stand maneuver (STS), postural activity becomes intermingled with the activity required to perform the actual movement, and is usually difficult to recognize.
Methods: In this paper, we have analyzed the elechomyographic activity of muscles of the leg, thigh, trunk and neck in 20 healthy volunteers who performed the STS maneuver. In order to identify the postural and the executional EMG activity, subjects were requested to perform. the movement according to 6 predefined experimental conditions. Our hypothesis was that changing the conditions or the strategies of the movement would modify the postural activity, without significantly altering the EMG pattern required for performing the movement itself.
Results: Tibialis anterior (TA), abdominal (ABD) and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) were the muscles activated first in the most natural condition for the movement (reference), but their activity and that of the trapezius (TRA) was suppressed or greatly diminished in other conditions. Conversely, lumbar paraspinal (LPS), quadriceps (QUA), and hamstrings (HMS) were activated in a patterned sequence that was invariable in all conditions, and time locked to the moment of lake-off from the seat. The soleus (SOL) was the last muscle activated and, together with QUA and HMS, remained active during standing.
Conclusions: We conclude that TA, SOL, ABD, SCM and TRA are involved in preparatory and accompanying postural movements, while LPS, QUA, and HMS are activated in a consistent patterned sequence and can be considered the executional muscles for the STS movement. Recognition of the role of each muscle in the STS movement can contribute to a better understanding of the movement deficits of certain patients, and help to devise adaptive motor strategies in neurorehabilitation.

Very often the barycenter of the quaternions or matrices that represent the rotations are used as an estimate of the mean. These methods neglect that rotations belong to a non-linear manifold and re-normalization or orthogonalization must be applied to obtain proper rotations. These latter steps have been viewed as ad hoc corrections for the errors introduced by assuming a vector space. The article shows that the two approximative methods can be derived from natural approximations to the Riemannian metric, and that the subsequent corrections are inherent in the least squares estimation.},

This study aimed to quantify the usual frequency and distribution of the STS movement performed by older adults in both home and rehabilitation settings. Methods: Three groups of older adults were recruited; healthy older adults living in the community, older adults living in the community attending rehabilitation services at a day hospital, and frail older patients in a rehabilitation ward. Participants wore an activity monitor, which reported posture continuously for a week. The number of STS movements was the primary outcome measure, and mean values of daily STS frequency were reported. The pattern of activity was investigated using median values of STS hourly rate. Results: Healthy older adults living in the community performed significantly more STS movements per day (n=20; 71 +/- 25) than either older adults attending a day hospital (n=20; 57 +/- 23) or frail older patients in a rehabilitation ward (n=30; 36 +/- 16). For all participants, the hourly rate of STS movements ranged from zero to 48, although the median hourly rate was two (healthy older adults) and one (both rehabilitation groups). Conclusion: Measurement of the number of STS movements performed over the course of a week in three groups of older adults, demonstrated significant differences in daily number of STS movements and in the hourly pattern between the groups. Activity patterns can provide additional information on clinically relevant aspects of physical activity and function to daily averages. (C) 2011, Editrice Kurtis},

Under mattress pressure sensor technology represents a way to monitor changes in this basic but critical mobility task among older adults at risk of institutionalization. However, little is known about normal variations in this ability over time in the home context. This study used under mattress pressure sensors to measure and analyze the variability of sit-to-stand (STS) timing in a community-dwelling older adult. A pressure-sensitive mat was installed in the participant's home and left in place to collect information over a period of nine months. A processing algorithm was developed to extract the STS phase of the first morning bed exit from which STS time could be measured. STS timing data were visualized using a histogram and analyzed for trends over the extended period using nonparametric regression and wavelet analysis. Results indicate that the analytical methods used were able to identify trends in STS timing as well as highlight deviations. The ability to collect and analyze the variability of STS timing using this pressure sensitive technology combined with the analysis methodology provides clinicians with a way to assess mobility remotely in the home setting.},

Due to severe loss of leg strength old adults are required to change the way they rise from a chair and maintain stability. Here we examine whether old compared to young adults differently prioritize task-important performance variables and whether there are age-related differences in the use of available motor flexibility. We applied the uncontrolled manifold analysis to decompose trial-to-trial variability in joint kinematics into variability that stabilizes and destabilizes task-important performance variables. Comparing the amount of variability stabilizing and destabilizing task-important variables enabled us to identify the variable of primary importance for the task. We measured maximal isometric voluntary force of three muscle groups in the right leg. Independent of age and muscle strength, old and young adults similarly prioritized stability of the ground reaction force vector during sit-to-stand. Old compared to young adults employed greater motor flexibility, stabilizing ground reaction forces during sit-to-sand. We concluded that freeing those degrees of freedom that stabilize task-important variables is a strategy used by the aging neuromuscular system to compensate for strength deficits.},

It is important to understand what factors limit performance of the task in older people, so that effective remedial approaches call be developed. In this study, we quantified lower-extremity muscle strength and chair-rise biomechanics in 12 young and 26 healthy elderly women during chair rise at normal and fast speeds without use of the hands. We found that hip and knee extensor torques, vertical and horizontal momentum, and vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces increased in the same way with speed for all subjects. All subjects increased their speed from normal to fast trials, but the young subjects were able to rise more quickly in the fast trials. In the normal speed trials, elderly subjects generated more trunk flexion and horizontal momentum while still in contact with the chair. Muscle activity patterns were similar for all subjects except that the elderly activated the ankle extensors earlier than the young. Although the elderly subjects were much weaker relative to body weight than the young subjects (48.5 +/- 14.1%), they were able to generate sufficient torques to perform the task. However, age-related differences suggest that chair-rise biomechanics were affected by the reduction in muscle strength, and that strength training regimens, particularly for the hip musculature, may be important to maintain chair-rise ability in the elderly.

   abstract = {In performing the sit-to-stand transition, young children (6- to 7-year-olds) were expected to display a movement form similar to that of adults. However, movement consistency was predicted to be poorer in children than in adults because they lack refinement of motor control processes. Kinematic analysis of 10 repetitions of the sit-to-stand movement was carried out for 6 typically developing children and 6 adults. Supporting the authors' prediction of comparable form, no differences were evident between age groups for sequence of joint onsets, proportional duration of segmental motion, or in angle-angle plots of displacement at 2 segments. In contrast, within-participant variability was found to be higher for children: Coefficients of variation for most kinematic measures were twice those seen for adults. The authors interpret the children's lack of movement consistency as a reflection of inadequate stabilization of an internal model of intersegmental dynamics. Whereas adults have attained a skill level associated with refinement of that model, children have not. Children have an additional control problem because changes in body morphology throughout childhood require ongoing updating of the internal model that controls intrinsic dynamics.},

Purpose: To evaluate the effect of motor imagery practice on the performance of sit to stand (STS) and reaching to grasp in subjects with post stroke chronic hemiparesis. Method: The study was designed as a crossover intervention. Participants were 13 individuals (mean age, 68.9 [+/- 4.9] years) with chronic hemiparesis enrolled in a day center at the Bet-Rivka Rehabilitation Hospital in Petach Tikvah, Israel. Following 1 week of baseline measurements of the performance of STS and reaching to grasp, these functions were mentally practiced for 15 minutes 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Half of the subjects mentally practiced STS, while the other half practiced the reaching imagery protocol. Subsequently, the participants in each group crossed over to practice the second function for the next 4 weeks. All practice sessions were performed according to a pre-established protocol under supervision. Measurements of real performance took place twice before and twice immediately following each practice session. For STS, the Tetrax Balance System was used to measure the speed of performance and weight distribution between the legs. Reaching to grasp was appraised via a "kinematic" glove and included speed variables of the hand. Results: A significant decrease was found in the values of STS duration. Weight distribution between the legs was not affected by the intervention. For reaching to grasp, a significant improvement was found in the mean and the maximum reaching velocity. Conclusions: In individuals with chronic hemiparesis, the imagery practice of meaningful motor tasks can positively affect real performance.},

   abstract = {The changes that take place during aging predispose the elder adult to frequent falls. In clinical practice fall risk is assessed by clinical tests that many times lack analytical power, therefore making it necessary to describe which of the clinical tests are related to the analytical biomechanical parameters in order to assign such characteristics to these functional tests. The objective of this work was to describe the existence of a correlation between the score of the functional test "Timed up and go" (TUG) and the joint moments of lower limb obtained during the execution of the sit to stand (STS) transfer in elderly subjects with a history of frequent falls. A sample of 30 volunteers was obtained; all were elders with a history of frequent falls. They were assessed with the functional test of TUG. Also assessed were the joint moments of the lower limb with motion analysis system. There is significant correlation (r=0.39; p=0.03) between the score obtained in the TUG and the maximum joint moment of the knee. For the sample assessed, the time of execution of the test "Timed up and go" was indicative of the capacity to generate a joint moment by the flexion-extensor muscles of the knee in subjects with a history of frequent falls.},

   abstract = {[Purpose] We aimed to investigate postural balance after sit-to-stand (STS) training with different nonparetic foot positions in stroke patients. [Subjects] Thirty-six subjects who experienced a stroke (21 males, 15 females) participated and were divided into the symmetric foot position (SYMM), asymmetric foot position (ASYM), and step foot (STEP) groups. [Methods] Each group performed repetitive sit-to-stand training 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The timed up-and-go test (TUG), functional reach test (FRT), and F-mat system correcting the anterior/posterior (A-P) and medial/lateral (M-L) distance of the center of pressure (COP) were used to measure the static and dynamic postural balance pre- and postintervention. ANCOVA was used to analyze differences among groups, and preintervention variables were used as covariates. [Results] The TUG, FRT, and A-P and M-L distance of the COP in the ASYM and STEP groups were significantly decreased after intervention compared with the SYMM group. All parameters in the STEP group were lower than those in the ASYM group, without a significant difference. [Conclusion] The asymmetric foot position during STS is a good intervention to improve the static and dynamic postural balance in stroke patients. Especially, using a step to change the foot position is effective in improving STS performance.},

Nineteen healthy adults aged 25 to 38 years (($) over bar X=31.7, SD=4.2) participated. Methods. Horizontal and vertical components of CM momentum were computed for STS transfers made at three movement speeds (fast, natural, and slow) with the aid of a motion analysis system. Two force platforms detected the time when the subject lost contact with the chair and the propulsive and braking impulses in the horizontal and vertical directions. Separate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for three temporal variables (time to peak horizontal and vertical momentum and time to when the subject lost contact with the chair) and two magnitude variables (peak horizontal and vertical momentum). Results. The ICCs for magnitude variables were greater than or equal to .81 for an speeds of movement. The ICCs for temporal variables ranged from .28 for fast movements to .75 for slow movements. Conclusion and Discussion. Measurement of peak vertical and horizontal momentum magnitudes is highly reproducible during STS transfers. Measurement of temporal variables exhibits a range of reliability estimates. Implications include consideration of the speed at which STS transfer is performed and its effect on reliability estimates and the potential differences between reliability estimates for magnitude measurements versus temporal measurements.},

   abstract = {Quaternions play a vital role in the representation of rotations in computer graphics, primarily for animation and user interfaces. Unfortunately, quaternion rotation is often left as an advanced topic in computer graphics education due to difficulties in portraying the four-dimensional space of the quaternions. One tool for overcoming these obstacles is the quaternion demonstrator, a physical visual aid consisting primarily of a belt. Every quaternion used to specify a rotation can be represented by fixing one end of the belt and rotating the other. Multiplication of quaternions is demonstrated by the composition of rotations, and the resulting twists in the belt depict visually how quaternions interpolate rotation.This article introduces to computer graphics the exponential notation that mathematicians have used to represent unit quaternions. Exponential notation combines the angle and axis of the rotation into concise quaternion expression. This notation allows the article to present more clearly a mechanical quaternion demonstrator consisting of a ribbon and a tag, and develop a computer simulation suitable for interactive educational packages. Local deformations and the belt trick are used to minimize the ribbon's twisting and simulate a natural-appearing interactive quaternion demonstrator.},

Nineteen participants completed a multi-stage test at different STS frequencies of 6, 10, 15, 20 and 30 repetitions per minute. The expired gas, heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. The relationship between EE and STS frequency was obtained and the slope of the regression was quantified as the EE of an STS.
The gross EE and HR increased linearly as the STS frequency increased in all participants. The net EE of an STS was 0.92 +/- A 0.37 kJ. The EE of an STS increased as the height and weight increased, and these relationships were well fit by quadratic regression. The metabolic equivalent (Met) of performing 15 STSs per minute was 4.3 +/- A 1.0 Mets and RPE was 12 +/- A 1 over a total of 20.
This study demonstrated that the EE of an instantaneous movement can be quantified by relating the gross EE and different frequencies of movement. Using this method, we quantified the EE of an STS, which varied depending on participants' anthropometrics. Mets of repetitive STS movement ranged from 2.6 to 7.2. This physiological profile is useful when performing repetitive STS movements as a form of exercise.},

Objective: To evaluate the effect of seat height on sit-to-stand (STS) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and in children without disabilities.
Design: A mixed design (subject type by seat height) with repeated measures for seat height.
Setting: Motion analysis laboratory.
Participants: Ten children with mild CP (mean age, 10.9 +/- 2.7y) and 10 children without disabilities (mean age, 8.7 +/- 2.4y).
Interventions: Kinematic and force measurements of STS were completed with 6 infrared cameras and 2 forceplates.
Main Outcome Measures: Phase duration of the STS movement, amplitude and timing of ground reaction forces, and maximum head velocity during the movement.
Results: Children with CP took significantly longer to rise to standing (1.71s) than children without disabilities (1.24s) (17(1,18) = 16.97). The extension phase of STS was also significantly longer for children with CP (.85s) than for children without disabilities (.45s) (F-1,F-18 = 18.73). Seat height did not affect time to stand for either children with CP or children without disabilities (F-1,F-18 = 2.82, P > .05). The duration of the extension phase, maximum horizontal and vertical velocity of the head, and maximum vertical ground reaction force were all significantly greater when children stood from the low bench height than from the higher bench height, although we found no significant differences by subject type for maximum horizontal and vertical head velocity or for maximum vertical ground reaction force.
Conclusions: Although children with CP were able to modify their motor programs for STS to accommodate changes in seat height as readily as nondisabled children, the speed with which they extended against gravity was slower; therefore, the total STS movement took longer for them to complete than for children without disabilities. Because the time to complete STS from the low and high bench did not differ, it would appear that time to ascend from sitting may be invariant and therefore be a motor control parameter for the STS movement.},

Microprocessor prosthetic knees' abilities to assist transfemoral amputees with sitting and standing have not been studied. Through cross-sectional study, 21 transfemoral amputees, divided into 3 groups of 7 by knee type (power knee, C-leg. Mauch SNS) and 7 non-amputee controls (n = 28) performed sit to stand and stand to sit while kinematic and kinetic data were recorded. Transfemoral amputees can stand (1.6-2.0 s) and sit (2.1-2.8 s) at rates comparable to controls (1.6 s). Controls' ground reaction force (GRF) and knee moment production was <7% asymmetric and superior- to amputees' during both movements. For sit to stand, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 53 to 69% and 110 to 124% for knee moments. For stand to sit, amputees' asymmetry for GRF ranged from 32 to 60% and 84 to 114% for knee moments. Hip moment asymmetry for sit to stand was less for control (21%) and power knee (34%) groups than that produced by the Mauch SNS (59%) group. For stand to sit, hip moment production for the Mauch SNS (47%) and C-leg groups (71%) were more asymmetric than controls (19%). In the majority of cases transfemoral amputees do not load their prosthesis extensively for standing up or sitting down. Therefore, this transitional movement is currently a one-legged task, which increases stress on the sound limb. Generally, the prosthetic knees studied did not produce a significant knee moment in either task. Although most differences between knee groups were not statistically significant, differences may be clinically meaningful on an individual basis. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis whether weight transfer during sit-to-stand (STS) is the result of coordinated ground forces exerted by buttocks and feet before seat-off. Wholebody kinematics and three-dimensional ground forces from left and right buttock as well as from left and right foot were recorded for seven adults during STS. We defined a preparatory phase from onset of the first detectable anterior/posterior (A/P) force to seat-off (buttock forces fell to 0) and a rising phase from seat-off to the decrease of center of mass (CoM) vertical velocity to zero. STS was induced by an increase of vertical and backward directed ground forces exerted by the buttocks that significantly preceded the onset of any trunk movement. All ground forces peaked before or around the moment of seat-off, whereas all kinematic variables, except trunk forward rotation and hip flexion, peaked after seat-off, during or after the rising phase. The present study suggests that the weight transfer from sit to stand is induced by ground forces exerted by buttocks and feet before seat-off, i.e., during the preparatory phase. The buttocks generate the isometric "rising forces," e.g., the propulsive impulse for the forward acceleration of the body, while the feet apply adequate damping control before seat-off. This indicates that the rising movement is a result of these coordinated forces, targeted to match the subject's weight and support base distance between buttocks and feet. The single peaked, bell-shaped profiles peaking before seat-off, were seen beneath buttocks for the "rising drive," i.e., between the time of peak backward directed force and seat-off, as well as beneath the feet for the "damping drive," i.e., from onset to the peak of forward-directed force and for CoM AIP velocity. This suggests that both beginning and end of the weight transfer process are programmed before seat-off. The peak deceleration of A/P CoM took place shortly (similar to 100 ms) after CoM peak velocity, resulting in a well controlled CoM deceleration before seat-off. In contrast to the view of other authors, this suggests that body equilibrium is controlled during weight transfer.},

Situation-adapted optimal assistance will be provided by the device both proactively and adaptively through behavior-based and context-aware robot control based on multimodal action recognition. The design of such a device, including the choice of actuators, which can provide the desired level of support without losing balance, is a challenging task. For these design choices, in particular STS motions have to be considered since they are more demanding for both the patient and the device. In this paper, we present a model-based optimization approach to this design task, using direct multiple shooting optimal control methods. They are applied to simultaneously determine optimal states and controls as well as the optimal mechanical design parameters of the assistive device that provide optimal STS assistance to subjects from a range of body heights and weights that represents the MOBOT target group.},

We extend the definition of the familiar cubic spline curves and splines in tension, and we show how to compute these on parametric surfaces, level sets, triangle meshes, and point samples of surfaces. This list is more comprehensive than it looks, because it includes variational motion design for animation, and allows the treatment of obstacles via barrier surfaces. All these instances of the general concept are handled by the same geometric optimization algorithm, which minimizes an energy of curves on surfaces of arbitrary dimension and codimension.},

   abstract = {Increased joint stress and malalignment are etiologic factors in osteoarthritis. Static tibiofemoral frontal plane malalignment is associated with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Patellofemoral joint stress is increased by activities such as sit-to-stand (STS); this stress may be even greater if dynamic frontal plane tibiofemoral malalignment occurs. If hip muscle or quadriceps weakness is present in persons with PFOA, aberrant tibiofemoral frontal plane movement may occur, with increased patellofemoral stress. No studies have investigated frontal plane tibiofemoral and hip kinematics during STS in persons with PFOA or the relationship of hip muscle and quadriceps strength to these motions. Eight PFOA and seven control subjects performed STS from a stool during three-dimensional motion capture. Hip muscle and quadriceps strength were measured as peak isometric force. The PFOA group demonstrated increased peak tibial abduction angles during STS, and decreased hip abductor, hip extensor, and quadriceps peak force versus controls. A moderate inverse relationship between peak tibial abduction angle and peak hip abductor force was present. No difference between groups was found for peak hip adduction angle or peak hip external rotator force. Dynamic tibiofemoral malalignmeat and proximal lower extremity weakness may cause increased patellofemoral stress and may contribute to PFOA incidence or progression.},

   abstract = {Cardiac baroreflex gain is usually quantified as the reflex alteration in heart rate during changes in blood pressure without considering the effect of the rate of change in blood pressure on the estimated gain. This study sought to (i) characterize baroreflex gain as a function of blood pressure oscillation frequencies using a repeat sit-to-stand method and (ii) compare baroreflex gain values obtained using the sit-to-stand method against the modified Oxford method. Fifteen healthy individuals underwent the repeated sit-to-stand method in which blood pressure oscillations were driven at 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 Hz. Sixteen healthy participants underwent the sit-to-stand and modified Oxford methods to examine their agreement. Sit-to-stand baroreflex gain was highest at 0.05 Hz (8.8 +/- 3.2 ms.mm Hg-1) and lowest at 0.1 Hz (5.8 +/- 3.0 ms.mm Hg-1). Baroreflex gains at 0.03 Hz (7.7 +/- 3.0 ms.mm Hg-1) and 0.07 Hz (7.5 +/- 3.3 ms.mm Hg-1) were not different from the baroreflex gain at 0.05 Hz. There was moderate correlation between phenylephrine gain and sit-to-stand gain (r values ranged from 0.52 to 0.75; all frequencies, p < 0.05), but no correlation between sodium nitroprusside gain and sit-to-stand gain (r values ranged from -0.07 to 0.22; all p < 0.05). Bland-Altman analysis of phenylephrine gain and sit-to-stand gain showed poor agreement and a positive proportional bias. These results show that baroreflex gains derived from these 2 methods cannot be used interchangeably. Furthermore, cardiac baroreflex gain is frequency dependent between 0.03 Hz and 0.1 Hz, which challenges the conventional practice of summarizing baroreflex gain as a single number.},

   abstract = {Baroreflex assessment has diagnostic and prognostic utility in the clinical and research environments, and there is a need for a reliable, simple, noninvasive method of assessment. The repeated sit-to-stand method induces oscillatory changes in blood pressure (BP) at a desired frequency and is suitable for assessing dynamic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). However, little is known about the reliability of this method and its ability to discern fundamental properties of the baroreflex. In this study we sought to: 1) evaluate the reliability of the sit-to-stand method for assessing BRS and compare its performance against two established methods (Oxford method and Valsalva maneuver), and 2) examine whether the frequency of the sit-to-stand method influences hysteresis. Sixteen healthy participants underwent three trials of each method. For the sit-to-stand method, which was performed at 0.1 and 0.05 Hz, BRS was quantified as an integrated response (BRSINT) and in response to falling and rising BP (BRSDOWN and BRSUP, respectively). Test retest reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Irrespective of frequency, the ICC for BRSINT during the sit-to-stand method was >= 0.88. The ICC for a rising BP evoked by phenylephrine (PEGAIN) in the Oxford method was 0.78 and <= 0.5 for the remaining measures. During the sit-to-stand method, hysteresis was apparent in all participants at 0.1 Hz but was absent at 0.05 Hz. These findings indicate the sit-to-stand method is a statistically reliable BRS assessment tool and suitable for the examination of baroreflex hysteresis. Using this approach we showed that baroreflex hysteresis is a frequency-dependent phenomenon.},

The primary purpose was to compare upper and lower extremity movement strategies using the vertical ground reaction force during a Sit to Stand task in participants recovering from a hip fracture to control participants. The secondary purpose was to evaluate the correlation between vertical ground reaction force variables and validated functional measures.
Methods: Twenty eight community dwelling older adults, 14 who had a hip fracture and 14 control participants completed the Sit to Stand task on an instrumented chair designed to measure vertical ground reaction force, performance based tests (Timed up and go, Berg Balance Scale and Gait Speed) and a self report Lower Extremity Measure. A MANOVA was used to compare functional scales and vertical ground reaction force variables between groups. Bivariate correlations were assessed using Pearson Product Moment correlations.
Findings: The vertical ground reaction force variables showed significantly higher bilateral arm force, higher uninvolved side peak force and asymmetry between the involved and uninvolved sides for the participants recovering from a hip fracture (Wilks' Lambda = 3.16, P = 0.019). Significant correlations existed between the vertical ground reaction force variables and validated functional measures. Interpretation: Participants recovering from a hip fracture compensated using their arms and the uninvolved side to perform a Sit to Stand. Lower extremity movement strategies captured during a Sit to Stand task were correlated to scales used to assess function, balance and falls risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Due to the complexity of rendering realistic rigid-body motions in the computer, rigid-body motions are often sampled from the physical world motions. Yet, sampling processes introduce noise; excessive noise results in tremulous motions in a VR environment. The noise-embedded motion data are decomposed using multiresolution analysis and the noise is detected as components of small magnitude. By eliminating the small-magnitude components, a smooth representation of the motion data is achieved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of using a cane on movement time, joint moment, weight symmetry, and muscle activation patterns during sit-to-stand (STS) transfer in healthy subjects and subjects who have had a stroke.
Design: Nine subjects with hemiparesis (mean [SD] age, 61.11 [12.83] yrs) and nine healthy adults (mean [SD] age, 63.11 [10.54] yrs) were included. The subjects with hemiparesis performed STS transfer in two randomly assigned conditions: (1) without a cane and (2) with a cane. The healthy subjects performed only STS transfer without a cane. A three-dimensional motion system, force plates, and eletromyography were used to examine STS transfer. The symmetry index between the two limbs was calculated.
Results: The movement time of the subjects with hemiparesis in both conditions without a cane and with a cane was longer than that of the healthy subjects without a cane (P < 0.025). However, STS transfer with a cane in the subjects with hemiparesis resulted in shorter movement time, greater knee extensor moment of the paretic limb, and more symmetry of weight bearing than in those without a cane (P < 0.05). The sequence of muscle onset tended to improve with a cane in the subjects with hemiparesis.
Conclusions: Cane use may promote more symmetrical STS transfers rather than compensation by the unaffected limb.},

The user's weight was supported partially by a gas spring mechanism underneath the chair. As a result, despite a few of heavier and lighter users, most of the users felt easier in both rising-up and sitting-down. This study proposes a new assistive chair design in which the gas spring mechanism can be adjusted in different angles to fit different weights of people. An evaluation was carried out. 30 older people aged between 62 and 84 years (mean=70, std. dev. =6.3, 15 females and 15 males, 14 were healthy and 16 had minor arthritic rheumatics or waist pain) were recruited to evaluate the design. Speed for sitting-down and rising-up were measured. Video was taken to observe changes of respondents' trunk-angle during use. The user's satisfaction was also measured in a ten-point scale. The result shows the design works better than the previous one which the gas spring is fixed. The lager the angle of gas spring the larger the force provided for helping the subject rising up and sitting down to the chair. The heavier people need a larger angle. Users rising up from the chair need a larger angle than sitting down.},

Differences in kinematics and kinetics at the hip during activities of daily living such as sit-to-stand (STS) may contribute to this risk. Nine high body mass index (BMI) subjects (mean BMI 31.2) and ten normal BMI control subjects (mean BMI 22.1) were analyzed using force plates and an optoelectronic motion capture camera system during controlled STS movement. Flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation angles and moments at the hip and knee were calculated using a musculoskeletal model. No differences were found at the knee. Peak hip abduction angles were on average 50% greater in the high BMI group compared to the normal group (p = 0.038). The hip was roughly 50% more abducted throughout the entire STS cycle in the high BMI group. Peak normalized hip abduction moments were approximately twice as large in the high BMI group (p = 0.005). Further research is required to determine if this increase in abduction angle and moment observed during STS is a contributor to risk for complications following THA in obese subjects.

Thirty DMD boys performed sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit from the chair 4times. Scale development was based on a previous movement characterization in healthy children and in DMD children and on suggestions by physical therapists with expertise in DMD. The final version of the scale was submitted to the analysis of reliability. The sitting evaluation consists of phases: flexion, contact of the hip with the chair, extension. The standing evaluation comprehends the phases: flexion; transference; extension. Sitting and standing phases presented an excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.91) and a good reproducibility (ICC 0.89). The scores generated by sitting on the chair correlated to the time taken to perform the tasks (r = .69) and to the age of the patient (r = .44) and the score of standing from the chair also correlated to the time of performance (r = .66). The sit-to-stand functional evaluation scale DMD is a reliable assessment tool that allows the description and quantification of the functional performance of DMD children.},

Moreover, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is used for feedback control. The overall control strategy is designated as ANFIS-PID control method. The results demonstrate that the control approach reduces deviations between desired and actual knee joint trajectories and succeeded controls knee joint motion during sit to stand movement.

   abstract = {As an infinite union operation, sweep of a moving object through space is a powerful and natural addition to the Boolean set operations that incorporates motion-related information for the purposes of shaping, collision detection, and simulation of moving objects. Use of sweep has been hindered by limited computational support and by the fact that it is a 'material growing' operation, whereas many applications, such as interference elimination and mechanism design, appear to be better modeled by a 'material removal' operation. This article formally defines a new geometric modeling operation of unsweep. Given an arbitrary subset E of Euclidean space and a general motion M, unsweep(E,M) returns the largest subset of E that remains inside the original E under M. When M is a translation, unsweep (E,M) naturally reduces to the standard Minkowski difference of E and the trajectory generated by the inverted motion (M) over cap. In this sense, the operation of unsweep is a generalization of Minkowski difference that corresponds to a 'material removal' operation, it can be also defined as an infinite intersection operation, and is the dual of sweep in a precise set-theoretic sense. We show that unsweep has attractive theoretical and computational properties, including a practical point membership test for arbitrary general motions. Using duality, the established properties of unsweep is extended to the general sweep operation, and can be used to improve the computational support for general sweeps.

The instantaneous chip geometry is accurately and reliably extracted from the B-rep model of the updated part. Also, the material removal in ball-end milling is precisely simulated for finishing operations, in order to construct the feed-mark and scollop geometries.

   abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically have difficulty rising from a chair. A major contributing factor may be altered anticipatory postural control; this hypothesis has been fueled by reports of altered function of the supplementary motor area in PD, an area linked to the preparation of movements. This study tested the hypothesis that individuals with PD would exhibit altered anticipatory postural control which would include a reduced preparatory hip flexion and decreased forward displacement of the COM prior to lift-off of the buttocks from the chair. Ten male subjects with PD and ten male age-matched controls were instructed to rise from a chair without the use of their arms at their comfortable pace on two separated days during on and off-medication states. Body movements were recorded with an optoelectronic device, in addition to forces under the buttocks and each foot to calculate lower extremity joint angles, joint movements and net body centre of mass displacement (COM). The sit-to-stand (STS) duration was the same for the PD-on and controls, but greater for the PD-off group. The PD groups (on and off) used a hip flexion strategy (greater preparatory hip flexion displacement and forward COM displacement, reduced knee extensor moments) compared to the controls. Contrary to predictions, subjects with PD exaggerated, rather than reduced, the movement preparation of the STS using a hip flexion strategy. Possible underlying causes of this flexion strategy could include compensation for poor lower extremity muscle strength and a need for greater postural stability during the lift-off phase.},

   abstract = {It is becoming increasingly evident that people with chronic, recurrent low back pain (LBP) exhibit changes in cerebrocortical activity that associate with altered postural coordination, suggesting a need for a better understanding of how the experience of LBP alters postural coordination and cerebrocortical activity. To characterize changes in postural coordination and pre-movement cerebrocortical activity related to the experience of acutely induced LBP, 14 healthy participants with no history of LBP performed sit-to-stand movements in 3 sequential conditions: (1) without experimentally induced LBP; NoPain1, (2) with movement-associated LBP induced by electrocutaneous stimulation; Pain, and (3) again without induced LBP; NoPain2. The Pain condition elicited altered muscle activation and redistributed forces under the seat and feet prior to movement, decreased peak vertical force exerted under the feet during weight transfer, longer movement times, as well as decreased and earlier peak hip extension. Stepwise regression models demonstrated that electroencephalographic amplitudes of contingent negative variation during the Pain condition significantly correlated with the participants' change in sit-to-stand measures between the NoPain1 and Pain conditions, as well as with the subsequent difference in sit-to-stand measures between the NoPain1 and NoPain2 conditions. The results, therefore, identify the contingent negative variation as a correlate for the extent of an individual's LBP-related movement modifications and to the subsequent change in movement patterns from before to after the experience of acutely induced LBP, thereby providing a direction for future studies aimed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the development of altered movement patterns with LBP.},

Additionally, the normalized EMG data of the SOL muscle increased significantly when the STS task was performed with hip adduction compared with hip abduction.

STS-related functioning was used to evaluate independent STS movement, rising speed, and actual STS performance during normal daily life. Methods. This was a prospective cohort study of 50 patients poststroke. Assessments were made at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 weeks poststroke. Actual STS performance was assessed at 0, 12, and 48 weeks. The main outcome measures were the following: ability to rise independently, rising speed (power chair stand up), number of STS movements, percentage of time walking and standing during daily life (using an activity monitor), and clinical outcomes, measured among others by the Barthel index (BI). Results. During year 1, the percentage of patients able to rise increased from 54% to 83%. Most improvements occurred during weeks 0 to 12, whereas no significant changes were observed during weeks 12 to 24. Rising speed similarly increased from 0.15 to 0.26 s(- 1) during weeks 0 to 12 and to 0.30 s(-1) at week 48. Gait speed and BI also significantly increased. The number of STS movements increased significantly during weeks 0 to 12 (from 10.6 to 17.7) but not during weeks 12 to 48. Conclusions. STS-related functioning improved significantly in the first year after stroke, with the most improvement occurring during the first 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, rising speed, gait speed, and BI continue to improve.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose. The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is a skill that helps determine the functional level of a person. Assessment of the STS movement has been done using quantitative and semiquantitative techniques. The purposes of this study were to identify the determinants of the STS movement and to describe their influence on the performance of the STS movement. Methods. A search was made using MEDLINE (1980-2001) and the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Institute for Scientific Information (1988-2001) using the key words "chair," "mobility," "rising," "sit-to-stand," and "standing." Relevant references such as textbooks, presentations, and reports also were included. Of the 160 identified studies, only those in which the determinants of STS movement performance were examined using an experimental setup (n=39) were included in this review. Results. The literature indicates that chair seat height, use of armrests, and foot position have a major influence on the ability to do an STS movement using a higher chair seat resulted in lower moments at knee level (up to 60%) and hip level (up to 50%); lowering the chair seat increased the need for momentum generation or repositioning of the feet to lower the needed moments. Using the armrests lowered the moments needed at the hip by 50%, probably without influencing the range of motion of the joints. Repositioning of feet influenced the strategy of the STS movement, enabling lower maximum mean extension moments at the hip (148.8 N(.)m versus 32.7 N(.)m when the foot position changed from anterior to posterior). Discussion and Conclusion. The ability to do an STS movement, according to the research reviewed, is strongly influenced by the height of the chair seat, use of armrests, and,foot position. More study of the interaction among the different determinants is needed. Failing to account for these variables may lead to erroneous measurements of changes in STS performance.

However, their use and interpretation are complicated by the fact that the signal is composed of different acceleration components. The aim of the study was to obtain insight into the components of accelerometer signals from the trunk and thigh segments during four different sit-to-stand (STS) movements (self-selected, slow, fast and fullflexion). Nine subjects performed at least six trials of each type of STS movement. Accelerometer signals from the trunk and thigh in the sagittal direction were decomposed using kinematic data obtained from an opto-electronic device. Each acceleration signal was decomposed into gravitational and inertial components, and the inertial component of the trunk was subsequently decomposed into rotational and translational components. The accelerometer signals could be reliably reconstructed: mean normalised root mean square (RMS) trunk: 6.5% (range 3-12%), mean RMS thigh: 3% (range 2-5%). The accelerometric signals were highly characteristic and repeatable. The influence of the inertial component was significant, especially on the timing of the specific event of maximum trunk flexion in the accelerometer signal. The effect of inertia was larger in the trunk signal than in the thigh signal and increased with higher speeds. The study provides insight into the acceleration signal, its components and the influence of the type of STS movement and supports its use in STS movement analysis.},

We compared accelerometric and opto-electronic assessment of the STS movement duration under four conditions (comfortable, slow, fast movement and exaggerated trunk flexion) with six healthy subjects and six subjects with stroke who performed movements six times under each condition. Accelerometric and opto-electronic data of STS movement duration were strongly related (r = 0.98). Accelerometry showed a fixed bias of 0.07 s (95% CI 0.008, 0.141) in healthy subjects and 0.32 s (95% CI 0.223, 0.422) in stroke subjects. In healthy subjects, a significant negative proportional bias of 0.1 was detected (95% CI -0.160, -0.032). Accelerometry showed discriminative validity in comparing stroke subjects to healthy subjects, and in comparing speed conditions. Our results indicate that accelerometry can provide valid data on the STS movement duration, furthermore during its use additional information on the STS movement, such as balance control, can be recorded.},

The aim of this study was to determine and compare the sensitivity of accelerometric balance parameters during the sit-to-stand (STS) movement. Eleven healthy subjects (four males, 28.2 +/- 7.9 years) and 31 patients with stroke (21 males; 63.3 +/- 12.8 years) were included. The healthy subjects performed STS movements in four conditions with different levels of difficulty. Data of the patients were compared 1) with healthy subjects, 2) between patient subgroups, and 3) between different phases of recovery to assess the sensitivity of accelerometry for differences in balance control. Accelerometers were attached to the trunk, and force plate measurements were simultaneously done in the healthy subjects. Main outcome measures were root mean square (rms) and area under the curve (AUC) derived from the high-frequency component of the transversal acceleration signal of the trunk. In all comparisons there was a significant difference in AUC data (p < 0.05), and AUC appeared to be more sensitive than rms. Variability in AUC was not completely or mainly the result of changes and differences in the duration of the STS movement. As a conclusion, accelerometry is a potentially valuable technique to measure balance during the STS movement.},

   abstract = {Background: Individuals with non-specific low back pain show decreased reliance on lumbosacral proprioceptive signals and slower sit-to-stand-to-sit performance. However, little is known in patients after lumbar microdiscectomy.
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned into transmuscular (n = 12) or paramedian lumbar surgery (n = 13). After surgery, the same patients were randomly assigned into individualized active physiotherapy starting 2 weeks after surgery (n = 12) or usual care (n = 13). Primary outcomes were center of pressure displacement during ankle and back muscles vibration (to evaluate proprioceptive use), and the duration of five sit-to-stand-to-sit movements, evaluated at 2 (baseline), 8 and 24 weeks after surgery.
Findings: Two weeks after surgery, all patients showed smaller responses to back compared to ankle muscles vibration (P < 0.05). Patients that underwent a transmuscular surgical procedure and patients that received physiotherapy switched to larger responses to back muscles vibration at 24 weeks, compared to 2 weeks after surgery (P < 0.005), although not seen in the paramedian group and usual care group (P > 0.05). Already 8 weeks after surgery, the physiotherapy group needed significantly less time to perform five sit-to-stand-to-sit movements compared to the usual care group (P < 0.05).
Interpretation: Shortly after lumbar microdiscectomy, patients favor reliance on ankle proprioceptive signals over lumbosacral proprioceptive reliance to maintain posture, which resembles the behavior of patients with non-specific low back pain. However, early active physiotherapy after lumbar microdiscectomy facilitated higher reliance on lumbosacral proprioceptive signals and early improvement of sit-to-stand-to-sit performance. Transmuscular lumbar surgery favoured recovery of lumbosacral proprioception 6 months after surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Functional activities, such as the sit-to-stand-to-sit (STSTS) task, are often impaired in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The STSTS task places a high demand on the postural control system, which has been shown to be impaired in individuals with COPD. It remains unknown whether postural control deficits contribute to the decreased STSTS performance in individuals with COPD.
Methods: Center of pressure displacement was determined in 18 individuals with COPD and 18 age/gender-matched controls during five consecutive STSTS movements with vision occluded. The total duration, as well as the duration of each sit, sit-to-stand, stand and stand-to-sit phase was recorded.
Results: Individuals with COPD needed significantly more time to perform five consecutive STSTS movements compared to healthy controls (1966 vs. 1364 seconds, respectively; p = 0.001). The COPD group exhibited a significantly longer stand phase (p = 0.028) and stand-to-sit phase (p = 0.001) compared to the control group. In contrast, the duration of the sit phase (p = 0.766) and sit-to-stand phase (p = 0.999) was not different between groups.
Conclusions: Compared to healthy individuals, individuals with COPD needed significantly more time to complete those phases of the STSTS task that require the greatest postural control. These findings support the proposition that suboptimal postural control is an important contributor to the decreased STSTS performance in individuals with COPD.},

Methods: To gain quantitative insight into in hospital mobilization, upright times and sit-to-stand transitions (STS) were measured using a thigh-mounted movement sensor in 44 participants (13 males and 31 females), age 50 to 82 years, in an observational, postsurgery, in hospital, longitudinal study.
Results: Some participants performed no activity in the first 24 hours after surgery. However, in the last 24 hours before discharge, participants performed a median of 40 (interquartile range [IQR], 15) STS and spent 134 minutes (IQR, 74 minutes) upright. Activity in rehabilitation constituted 19.4% (IQR, 15.8%) of STS and 13.3% (IQR, 5.5%) of upright time. Females spent longer in hospital (80 hours; IQR, 24) compared to males (54 hours; IQR, 26).
Conclusion: Although there was considerable activity within rehabilitation periods, a large majority of STS and upright time occurred outside rehabilitation. Within the last 24 hours in hospital, all participants were upright for prolonged periods and completed numerous STS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Roughly 6% of community-dwelling older adults experience significant difficulties with STS, a major risk factor for institutionalization. While mechanical STS assistance can help address this problem, full dependence on STS assistance provided by devices such as lift chairs can lead to atrophy of the leg muscles. We investigated the mechanics of assisted STS motion in order to better understand how load-sharing STS mechanisms may facilitate STS motions while still requiring activation of the leg muscles. Experiments were conducted with 17 nondisabled older adults performing unassisted and assisted STS rises with grab bar, arm, seat, and waist assistance. Each mode of rise was evaluated based on a subject questionnaire and key biomechanical metrics relating to stability, knee effort reduction, and rise trajectory. Results show that the seat- and waist-assist modes provide statistically significant improvements in stability metrics and reductions in required knee torques over unassisted rises and bar assistance. The assists most preferred by the subjects were the seat and bar assists. Overall, our results favor a seat-assisted STS modality for non-clinical applications and indicate further testing of this modality with a clinical population.},

   abstract = {Many applications in Computer Graphics require fast and robust 3D collision detection algorithms. These algorithms can be grouped into four approaches: space-time volume intersection, swept volume interference, multiple interference detection and trajectory parameterization. While some approaches are linked to a particular object representation scheme (e.g., space-time volume intersection is particularly suited to a CSG representation). others do not. The multiple interference detection approach has been the most widely used under a variety of sampling strategies, reducing the collision detection problem to multiple calls to static interference tests. In most casts, these tests boil down to detecting intersections between simple geometric entities, such as spheres, boxes aligned with the coordinate axes, or polygons and segments. The computational cost of a collision detection algorithm depends not only on the complexity of the basic interference test used, but also on the number of times this test is applied. Therefore. it is crucial to apply this test only at those instants and places where a collision can truly occur. Several strategies have been developed to this end. (1) to find a lower time bound fur the first collision, (2) to reduce the pairs of primitives within objects susceptible of interfering, and (3) to cut down the number of object pairs to be considered for interference. These strategies rely on distance computation algorithms, hierarchical object representations. orientation-based pruning criteria, and space: partitioning schemes. This paper tries to provide a comprehensive survey of all these techniques From a unified viewpoint. so that well-known algorithms are presented as particular instances of general approaches.

   abstract = {During stance, head extension increases postural sway, possibly due to interference with sensory feedback. The sit-to-stand movement is potentially destabilizing due to the development of momentum as the trunk flexes forward and the body transitions to a smaller base of support. It is unclear what role head orientation plays in the postural and movement characteristics of the sit-to-stand transition. The authors assessed how moving from sitting to standing with head-on-trunk extension compared with moving with the head neutral or flexed, or with moving with the head facing forward in space (which would involve head-on-trunk extension, but not head-in-space extension) in healthy, young participants. Head-on-trunk extension increased center of pressure variability, but decreased movement velocities, movement duration, and trunk flexion compared with flexed and neutral head-on-trunk orientations. Similarities in movement characteristics between head-on-trunk extension and the forward head-in-space orientation suggest that stabilizing the head in space does not fully counteract the postural and movement changes due to head-on-trunk extension. Findings suggest that proprioceptive feedback from the neck muscles contributes to the regulation of posture and movement, and therefore should not be overlooked in research on the role of sensory feedback in postural control.},

   abstract = {Background Moving from sitting to standing is a common activity of daily living. The five-repetition sit-to-stand test (5STS) is a test of lower limb function that measures the fastest time taken to stand five times from a chair with arms folded. The 5STS has been validated in healthy community-dwelling adults, but data in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) populations are lacking.
Aims To determine the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the 5STS in patients with COPD.
Methods Test-retest and interobserver reliability of the 5STS was measured in 50 patients with COPD. To address construct validity we collected data on the 5STS, exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk (ISW)), lower limb strength (quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction (QMVC)), health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) and composite mortality indices (Age Dyspnoea Obstruction index (ADO), BODE index (iBODE)). Responsiveness was determined by measuring 5STS before and after outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in 239 patients. Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) was estimated using anchor-based methods.
Results Test-retest and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. 5STS time correlated significantly with ISW, QMVC, SGRQ, ADO and iBODE (r=-0.59, -0.38, 0.35, 0.42 and 0.46, respectively; all p<0.001). Median (25th, 75th centiles) 5STS time decreased with PR (Pre: 14.1 (11.5, 21.3) vs Post: 12.4 (10.2, 16.3)s; p<0.001). Using different anchors, a conservative estimate for the MCID was 1.7s.
Conclusions The 5STS is reliable, valid and responsive in patients with COPD with an estimated MCID of 1.7s. It is a practical functional outcome measure suitable for use in most healthcare settings.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose: The Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST) has been established as a valid and reliable functional measure for older adults. Norms have been clearly defined for community-dwelling older adults and can be useful in the identification of mobility decline and prediction of future disability. However, because of the high rates of inactivity in the population of community-dwelling older adults, it seems inappropriate to compare high-functioning older adults, for example, senior athletes, to these norms. With trends showing increased senior athlete participation, new norms may be necessary to appropriately evaluate this population of older adults. The purpose of this study was to (1) compare results of the FTSST in senior athletes older than 60 years to norms for community-dwelling adults of the same age (2) determine the effects of age, gender, and sport intensity on FTSST performance in senior athletes, and (3) establish norms appropriate for this population of interest.
Methods: The FTSST was performed on 276 (104 men, 172 women) senior athletes age 50 to 91 years (mean age = 64.9, SD = 15) reporting an average of 4 hours of cardiovascular training and 1 hour of strength training each week. All were actively engaged in national or state senior game competitions.
Results: All participants were able to complete the test. One hundred ninety-four participants between 60 and 89 years of age showed significantly faster times than currently reported norms. Performance was negatively associated with age, but did not differ significantly between genders. Participants in more physically demanding sports did show the best FTSST times, although athletes engaged in more leisure sports still outperformed norms for community-dwelling seniors.
Conclusion: Senior athletes show significantly greater FTSST speed than norms derived from community-dwelling older adults. New normative guidelines are presented to assist the screening of these athletes on this functional performance measure.},

The objective would be to find optimal strategy for voluntary trunk movement, which would minimize hip, knee and ankle torques and demand minimal upper limb participation during the motion. Motion of the knee and the ankle were constrained by electrical stimulation. Motion capture (MOCAP) data, and signals from handle force sensors were acquired during FES-assisted rising motion of one paraplegic subject. Based on a 3 DOF dynamic model, we used an optimization algorithm in order to determine optimal trajectories in terms of minimizing joint torques for various conditions of force level applied to handles. Motion computed using the optimization process is compared with the one recorded during the experiment. Our results suggest that in order to minimize the sum of joint torques and arm effort participation, paraplegic patients should bend their body forward in order to use linear momentum of the trunk in sit off phase. This information can be used to design controller for closed-loop FES-assisted standing-up. The controller could use trunk motion to trigger legs stimulation in order to optimize body segment coordination.},

It comprises almost omnidirectional driving mechanism, sit-to-stand support mechanism, and motion compliance module to control the system. The development and evaluation of basic motion compliance algorithm shows that the algorithm for extraction of user intention from the interaction of the operator and the system determines performance of the system. The required parameters and performance index for improving sit-to-stand function are evaluated by the analysis of force reflection between the operator and the system. Finally, future research topics to improve the performance are addressed},

In some cases of five-axis machining, the swept volume may be self-intersecting, which requires special processing to handle the geometric and topological problems due to complex tool motion. In this work, an algorithm is proposed for generating the swept volume, including the self-intersection case for five-axis ball-end milling, based on triangle strip representation. The proposed algorithm has various applications such as interference detection in assembly design, and visualization of manipulator motions in robotics.},

   abstract = {Background: Functional evaluation of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activities is often used by physiotherapists in patients with neurological and musculoskeletal disorders. The observation of the way these activities are executed is essential in identifying kinesiological problems. There are different methodologies used to describe the stand-to-sit activity and its evaluation is not yet standardized, which makes the practical application of resources on clinical observation difficult. The objective of this study is to automate the decision making process of an evaluation protocol, developed in previous study, and facilitate its utilization by professionals in the area.
Methods: A decision-making system has been implemented through a computational tool, more specifically an Expert System that due its inherent characteristics emulates the decision-making process of a human expert in the domain area. A Shell called Expert Sinta was used to develop two knowledge bases, i.e. two expert systems, one for the anterior view and another for the lateral view of stand-to-sit activity. Variables, values, associated rules and confidence factors, objectives, and additional information questions were defined by the expert of domain and once implemented each expert system generates a number of questions to its user. These questions serve as a guide to physiotherapists and support the standardization of the activity evaluation. The developed systems were evaluated by physiotherapists through the application of a questionnaire that evaluates the knowledge base and the usability of the system. The physiotherapists' answers were then evaluated through statistical estimation and percentage analysis.
Results: When asked about the systems' "utility for clinical practice of the physiotherapist", 67% of evaluators answered positively. An interesting finding was that most physiotherapists (i.e. 92%) considered that the systems are suitable for educational purposes, which was not the main objective of this study.
Conclusions: The developed expert systems can support the physiotherapist in evaluating stand-to-sit activity through a conclusion suggestion about the "level of inadequacy" for the "degree of inadequacy" searched during its execution. Results of experts' evaluation analyzed through statistical methods indicate that the automation of protocols contributed to the standardization of the evaluation of stand-to-sit activity and that it has application for teaching purposes.},

   abstract = {Polynomial Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curves form a remarkable subclass of polynomial parametric curves; they are distinguished by having a polynomial arc length function and rational offsets (parallel curves). Many related references can be found in the article by Farouki and Neff on C-1 Hermite interpolation with PH quintics. We extend the C-1 Hermite interpolation scheme by taking additional curvature information at the segment boundaries into account. As a result we obtain a new construction of curvature continuous polynomial PH spline curves. We discuss Hermite interpolation of G(2) [C-1] boundary data (points, first derivatives, and curvatures) with PH curves of degree 7. It is shown that up to eight possible solutions can be found by computing the roots of two quartic polynomials. With the help of the canonical Taylor expansion of planar curves, we analyze the existence and shape of the solutions. More precisely, for Hermite data which are taken from an analytical curve, we study the behaviour of the solutions for decreasing stepsize Delta. It is shown that a regular solution is guaranteed to exist for sufficiently small stepsize Delta, provided that certain technical assumptions are satisfied. Moreover, this solution matches the shape of the original curve; the approximation order is 6. As a consequence, any given curve, which is assumed to be G(2) (curvature continuous) and to consist of analytical segments can approximately be converted into polynomial PH form. The latter assumption is automatically satisfied by the standard curve representations of Computer Aided Geometric Design, such as Bezier or B-spline curves. The conversion procedure acts locally, without any need for solving a global system of equations. It produces G(2) polynomial PH spline curves of degree 7.},

[Methods] Subjects did STSE and cycle ergometer exercise on the same day. The STSE protocol was standing-up frequencies set from 6 to 30 (times per minute),with an exercise time of three minutes at each frequency. The anaerobic threshold (AT) was determined on a cycle ergometer with a ramp protocol. The items measuring work load were oxygen uptake and heart rate. Cardiopulmonary function was measured from resting time to the end of the exercise. Oxygen uptake volume and heart rate relative to their AT values were calculated. [Results] Oxygen uptake volume and heart rate relative to their AT values frequencies from 6 to 30 times per minute ranged from 45.9 to 119.8 (%), and from 67.6 to 106.9 (%), respectively. [Conclusion] In case of STSE, the work load intensity of a subject cannot be quantitatively determined. Heart rate and oxygen uptake at standing exercise frequencies setting from 6 to 30 times/min relative to their anaerobic threshold values were 67.6-106.9 (%) and 45.9-119.8 (%), respectively. It was clarified that 30 times or less were anaerobic threshold that corresponded to work load. It is appropriate to adjust work load based on this standing up frequency only for young subjects.},

   abstract = {Background: Physical exercises are widely used in community programs, but not all older adults are willing to participate. Information and communication technology may solve this problem by allowing older people to participate in fitness programs at home. Use of remote instruction will facilitate physical exercise classes without requiring that participants gather at one place. The aim of this study was to examine use of a sit-to-stand task in evaluating motor function using conventional video communication in a telemetry system to enable real-time monitoring, and evaluation in physical performance of older adults at home.
Methods: The participants were 59 older individuals and 81 university students. Three physical exercise batteries were used: arm curl, figure-of-eight walk test, and functional reach. The knee extension maximum angular velocity (KEMAV) and the iliac elevation maximum velocity (IEMV) during standing up from a chair and the heel rise frequency were used in the motion-capture measurements. The results were assessed using multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) for the young and older groups.
Results: Young participants consistently performed better than their older counterparts on all items. Analyses with multi-group SEM based on correlations between items yielded a good model-fit for the data. Among all path diagrams for IEMV and KEMAV in the older and young groups, paths from muscular strength to skillfulness showed significant effects. The path from the IEMV to muscular strength was also significant in the older group.
Conclusions: Multi-group SEM suggested that video-based measurements of IEMV during sit-to-stand motion can estimate muscular strength, which suggests that remote monitoring of physical performance can support wellness of community-dwelling older adults.},

   abstract = {Background: This study examined whether the age-related change in power, calculated from the score of a sit-to-stand (STS) test, corresponds to those in knee extension torque and leg lean tissue mass in Japanese women aged 50 years or older.
Findings: Time for a 10-times-repeated STS test and knee extension torque were determined in 556 Japanese women aged 50 to 94 years. STS power was calculated using an equation reported previously. In addition, leg lean tissue mass was estimated using muscle thicknesses determined at thigh and lower leg. STS power, knee extension torque, and lean tissue mass were negatively correlated to age. STS power and knee extension torque, expressed as the percentages of the mean value of the corresponding variable for the subjects aged 50 to 54 years were lower than that of lean tissue mass in the subjects aged 60 years or over, and were similar in those aged under 75 years. However, the relative value of STS power was lower than that of knee extension torque in the subjects aged over 75 years.
Conclusions: In Japanese women aged 50 to 74 years, STS power can be a convenient measure for assessing the age-related decline in knee extension torque, but not for leg lean tissue mass. At over 75 years old, the magnitude of the age-related decline in STS power does not parallel to that in the force generation capability of knee extensor muscles.},

Each algorithm constructs a twice-differentiable curve on the rotation group SO(3) that interpolates a given ordered set of rotation matrices at specified knot times. Rotation matrices are parametrized, respectively, by the unit quaternion, Canonical co-ordinate, and Cayley-Rodrigues representations. All the algorithms share the common feature of (i) being invariant with respect to choice of fixed and moving frames (bi-invariant), and (ii) being cubic in the parametrized co-ordinates. We assess the performance of these algorithms by comparing the resulting trajectories with the minimum angular acceleration curve. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sedentary work is associated with many adverse health outcomes, and sit-stand workstations in offices have emerged as a way to counteract sedentary work.
OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the existing knowledge on sit-stand workstations, treadmill workstations and bicycle workstations.
METHODS: The inclusion/exclusion criteria were: 1) empirical research examining the effectiveness of sit-stand workstations in lab or field studies, 2) working adult population, 3) sit-stand workstation interventions where workers performed the same task from a seated or standing position, 4) outcomes measures of discomfort (comfort), performance, sit-stand behaviors, user satisfaction, kinematic and physiological measures. Search terms were: sit-stand, treadmill, bicycle, workstations, sedentary behavior, office ergonomics, and comfort.
RESULTS: Many studies considered productivity, comfort and physiological measures as important outcomes to assess the efficacy of sit-stand workstations and the experimental design was variable. Preliminary data suggests that some amount of standing during an 8-hour workday could be beneficial without compromising user comfort or productivity; however, there is very little data on the efficacy of treadmill and bicycle workstations.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these preliminary data from 26 studies, conducting large scale randomized controlled trials with ergonomic training as their essential component is recommended to understand the benefits of sit-stand workstations for prevention of sedentary work.},

In NC machining, a wide variety of cutter shapes are used such as flat end mills, dome end mills, ball nose end mills, angle cutters, face mills and side-and-face cutters. There are also many types of cutter paths along which the cutter is guided by the NC controller: rapid motion, linear motion and circular motion are the most commonly used cutter paths among them. Furthermore, the kinematics of the NC machines also differ leading to 2.5-axis, 3-axis and a variety of 5-axis configurations. The swept volume algorithms have to take into account all these variations of cutter shapes, motion types and machine kinematics. In this paper, first the parametric definition of a generic cutter is presented that can emulate all types of cutter shapes. Subsequently, the motions are classified into six types considering the cutter path and kinematic variations for ease of swept volume calculations. Finally, the swept volume algorithms for each of these six motion types are presented. These algorithms are used in a volumetric NC simulation system for which applications are envisaged in (a) NC verification and (b) optimization of the feed rate.},

   abstract = {Background. The principle of specificity in muscle training requires the training mode to reflect the desired outcome. The observed similarity of lower limb movements during recumbent cycling to the functional movements sit-to-stand and step-up presents the possibility of using recumbent cycling in a rehabilitation context. This may reduce the need to practice the actual task which in some, less able, patients may be labour intensive and patient fatiguing. To date no studies have compared recumbent cycling to these functional movements. This study therefore aimed to compare the lower limb kinematics and muscle activity between recumbent cycling and both sit-to-stand and step-up movements.
Methods. Electromyographic and kinematic signals from 12 young (mean age 42.1 years) healthy participants were collected during the performance of three activities: (1) cycling at 60 rpm, (2) sit-to-stand and (3) a single step-up. Only the extension phase of each movement was compared.
Findings. Although the results demonstrated differences in joint movement and muscle activation, e.g., greater gastrocnemius activity during recumbent cycling (P < 0.00), knee range of motion and average root mean square activity for rectus femoris, biceps femoris and the sum of the average activity for five muscles recorded showed no difference (P > 0.05) suggesting that there was sufficient agreement to support the use of recumbent cycling as a specific training modality for the sit-to-stand and step-up movements. This finding may have positive implications for the rehabilitation of a wide range of patients in the early stages of rehabilitation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background
Excessive sitting has been linked to poor health. It is unknown whether reducing total sitting time or increasing brief sit-to-stand transitions is more beneficial. We conducted a randomized pilot study to assess whether it is feasible for working and non-working older adults to reduce these two different behavioral targets.
Methods
Thirty adults (15 workers and 15 non-workers) age 50-70 years were randomized to one of two conditions (a 2-hour reduction in daily sitting or accumulating 30 additional brief sit-to-stand transitions per day). Sitting time, standing time, sit-to-stand transitions and stepping were assessed by a thigh worn inclinometer (activPAL). Participants were assessed for 7 days at baseline and followed while the intervention was delivered (2 weeks). Mixed effects regression analyses adjusted for days within participants, device wear time, and employment status. Time by condition interactions were investigated.
Results
Recruitment, assessments, and intervention delivery were feasible. The 'reduce sitting' group reduced their sitting by two hours, the 'increase sit-to-stand' group had no change in sitting time (p <.001). The sit-to-stand transition group increased their sit-to-stand transitions, the sitting group did not (p <.001).
Conclusions
This study was the first to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of specific sedentary behavioral goals.},

   abstract = {Objective. This study aimed to establish a basis of descriptive data for the sit-stand-sit movement cycle in 50 normal subjects, 25 male and 25 female, aged between 20.1 and 78.3 years (mean age 46.8 years).
Design. A descriptive design was employed to establish the characteristics of the activity in normal subjects.
Background. Research has been carried out into kinetic and kinematic characteristics of the sit-to-stand movement, but few researchers have considered stand-to-sit. Most studies have involved small samples, subjects with pathology, or elderly subjects, so a baseline of data from normal subjects has not yet been established.
Method. Linear displacement and acceleration of the trunk and angular displacement of the knee were recorded simultaneously within the same temporal framework. The measurement system consisted of a vector stereograph, and triaxial accelerometers located at the level of C-7, and an electrogoniometer located at the lateral aspect of the knee.
Subjects rose from and descended to the seated position a total of six times at their own self-selected speed. Numerical data were subjected to descriptive analysis, matched-pairs t tests and Pearson's rho correlations.
Results. Mean values for the time to rise was 1.91 s and to descend was 1.97 s. Forward lean velocity was greater during rising than descending (P<0.001), and recovery velocity was greater during descending than rising (P<0.001). Temporal contributions of forward lean and vertical displacement and the period of overlap between them were identified, and relationships between acceleration and temporal events and components were established. Differences existed among groups, involving primarily the elderly groups and occurring during the rising phase.
Conclusions. This study has proposed a baseline of descriptive data in normal subjects for the sit-stand-sit movement cycle.
Relevance
In practical and clinical applications of information gained from analysis of functional activities, establishment of what is accepted as 'normal' is necessary before abnormalities can be identified and analysed, and intervention implemented and evaluated. This study provides that basis. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Curve shape is represented by Fourier descriptors of cumulative angular deviation of the curve, which do not depend on the position or scale of the curve. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to learn the (unknown) relation between the Fourier descriptors of a planar curve and the dimensions of the mechanism tracing that curve. Presented with any simple, closed, planar curve, the ANN suggests the dimensions of a four-bar whose coupler curve is similar in shape. A local optimization procedure further refines the results. Examples presented indicate the method is successful as long as the curve shape is such that the mechanism is able to trace it.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the activation pattern of six lower limb muscles during standing up from two initial foot positions and to examine relationships between the onsets of muscle activity and the dynamics of the action. In contrast to earlier studies, an algorithm was used to measure onsets and duration of muscle activity.
Method. The activity of biceps femoris, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius and medial soleus was studied as nine male subjects between the ages of 20 and 35 stood up from two initial foot positions (foot forward, foot back). Subjects sat on a height-adjustable seat with their right foot on a force platform and were videotaped as they stood up.
Results. When the feet were forward there were significant increases in movement duration, displacement and velocity of trunk segment flexion at the hips reflecting the increased distance the body mass must be moved forward. The sequence of onsets and the duration of muscle activity, however, were consistent across the two conditions. Onsets of extension at hip, knee and ankle, however, correlated with different muscle activity depending on the foot position.
Conclusion. The results suggest that muscles working over different joints are temporally linked and that different muscle linkages may be utilised in the lower limb to coordinate the sit-to-stand action under different functional demands.},

   abstract = {When a linear actuator is used for rotation motion by a knee joint of an exoskeleton, the specifications of the joint range of motion (ROM) and joint torque change according to how the linear actuator are attached. Moreover, while the linear actuator generates a constant amount of force, the joint torque generated by the actuator changes according to the joint angle, which causes the torque contraction. This makes it difficult to meet the required torque and ROM for walk and stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand (STS) motions while carrying a load. To solve these problems we propose a novel knee joint for an exoskeleton with good energy efficiency during walk and STS motions while carrying a load. The mechanism is composed of a four-bar linkage and an elastic element. Based on an analysis of human motion, the design variables of the joint were optimized and the feasibility of the optimized variables was verified through the simulation. The findings from the simulation results suggest that combining a four-bar linkage with a linear actuator allows a large ROM and good torque performance of the knee joint for walk and STS motions. Moreover, the energy efficiency can be improved because the spring mounted parallel to the actuator can store the energy dissipated as negative work and recycle the energy as positive work.},

The resulting piecewise-screw motion is unique and coordinate system independent. Also, the motion is independent of the manner in which the key-poses were specified. Although any two arbitrary poses may be interpolated by an infinite of motions we advocate screw motions for their simplicity, uniqueness and computational advantages. We present a new and efficient algorithm for constructing the boundaries of swept volumes created by moving polyhedra in screw motions. The algorithm takes a generate-and-test approach by computing the candidate surfaces of boundaries and trimming them after applying the point-in-sweep test.

The Biodex Balance System, TUG, and 5XSST were used to measure the static and dynamic standing balance of each patient. A foot mat system was used to measure foot pressure. [Results] In the balance measurements, differences in the Overall index, Ant-post index, Med-lat index, Fall risk index, TUG, and 5XSST after training was significantly different between the two study groups. In evaluating foot pressure measurements, we found that the COP (Ant-post), Peak pressure: hind foot, and Contact area: hind foot measurements significantly differed between the groups after the training. [Conclusion] Repetitive sit-to-stand training that involves positioning the non-paretic leg upward can be considered a significant form of training that improves the symmetric posture adjustment and balance of hemiplegic patients following a stroke.},

We examined differences in the EMG data of the internal oblique, erector spinae, medial hamstring, and rectus femoris muscles during the STS task. The motion of the hip joint during an STS task was measured with a NorAngle Electrogoniometer System. Twelve young healthy women were recruited to this study. EMG characteristics and the hip joint angle were recorded during the performance of an STS task by subjects wearing high-heeled shoes of three different heel heights. The muscle onset time and EMG activity during this task were analyzed. In 8-cm high-heeled shoes, the onset time for the erector spinae muscle was significantly delayed, and the onset latency for the medial hamstring and the rectus femoris was significantly decreased. There was increased activity in the erector spinae and rectus femoris muscle during this task when wearing 8-cm high-heeled shoes. The initial hip flexion angle at the start point of the STS task did not differ among the 1-, 4-, and 8-cm heel-height conditions, but the trunk flexion angle, corresponding to the displacement between the peak hip flexion and initial hip flexion, was significantly larger in the 8-cm heel-height condition than in the 1- and 4-cm heel-height conditions. The findings suggest that excessive heel height has the potential to induce muscle imbalance during the STS task. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Given three solid orientations, a circular quaternion curve is constructed that interpolates the three orientations. Therefore, given four orientations q(i-1), q(i), q(i+1), q(i+2), there are two circular quaternion curves C-i and C-i+1 which interpolate the triples of orientations (q(i-1), q(i), q(i+1)) and (q(i). q(i+1), q(i+2)), respectively; thus, both C-i and C-i+1 interpolate the two orientations q(i) and q(i+1). Using a method similar to the parabolic blending of Overhauser, quaternion curve Q(i)(t) is generated which interpolates two orientations q(i) and q(i+1) while smoothly blending the two circular quaternion curves C-i(t) and C-i+1(t) with a blending function f(t) of degree (2k - 1). The quaternion curve Q(i) has the same derivatives (up to order k) with C-i at q(i) and with C-i+1 at q(i+1), respectively. By connecting the quaternion curve segments Q(i) in a connected sequence, a C-k-continuous quaternion path is generated which smoothly interpolates a given sequence of solid orientations.},

Objective: We examined the kinematics of STS movement using two adjustable handrails.
Methods: Seventy-five subjects (25 college students, 25 independent elderly people, and 25 physically challenged elderly people) participated in the study. Five types of handrail positions ('no handrails', 'both high', 'both low', 'high and low' and 'reverse high and low') were evaluated. Kinematic data were collected using a VICON analyzer and a Myosystem was used to collect the electromyographic data.
Results: STS movements with high and low handrails in the elderly subjects took the shortest time and showed the largest decrease in torque (15%) compared to no handrails. The 'high and low' position also reduced the loads to the greatest extent. The average time period for STS was reduced by 15 to 30% using the high and low handrails compared to no handrail for all three groups.
Conclusion: The 'high and low' handrail position best facilitates STS movement in the elderly by reducing the time needed to perform STS movements and by reducing the torque and subsequent wear on the joints and muscles.},

   abstract = {Background
Care-needing older adults and disabled individuals often require handrails for assistance of movements, such as sit-to-stand movements. Handrails must be set at the appropriate position; however, the effects of handrail height on joint movement and center-of-gravity movements during sit-to-stand movement remain unclear. In the present study, we sought to clarify the effects of handrail height on joint movement, center-of-gravity, and floor reaction force during sit-to-stand movement.
Methods
Subjects included 16 healthy young adults and 25 older adults who require long-term care. Kinetic and kinematic measurements during sit-to-stand movement of young adults were conducted using a 3-D motion analyzer and a force plate. Trunk forward tilt angle during sit-to- stand movement of older adults was measured using a still image from a video recording.
Results
Using low handrails, sit-to-stand movement resulted in an increased hip flexion angle, ankle dorsiflexion angle, and trunk forward tilt angle and a greater forward center-of-gravity shift than when not using handrails in young adults during seat-off. In contrast, using high handrails resulted in a smaller hip flexion angle and trunk forward tilt angle in young adults. The backward force on the floor was decreased in the low handrail condition, and was increased in the high handrail condition rather than that of sit-to-stand movement without handrails in young adults. The effect of handrail height on trunk forward tilt angle was the same in both healthy young adults and care-needing older adults during seat-off.
Conclusion
Because handrail height affects joint movement and shift in the center-of-gravity during sitto- stand movement, handrail position should be selected to match the status of older adults with functional impairment.},

   abstract = {Background: Individuals post hip fracture decrease force on the involved limb during sit to stand tasks, creating an asymmetry in vertical ground reaction force. Joint specific differences that underlie asymmetry of the vertical ground reaction force are unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare differences in vertical ground reaction force variables and joint kinetics at the hip and knee in participants post-hip fracture, who were recently discharged from homecare physical therapy to controls.
Methods: Forty-four community-dwelling older adults, 29 who had a hip fracture and 15 elderly control participant's completed the sit to stand task on an instrumented chair with 3 force plates. T-tests were used to compare clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, activity balance confidence and gait speed, isokinetic knee strength) and vertical ground reaction force variables. Two-way analyses of variance compared vertical ground reaction force variables and kinetics at the hip and knee between hip fracture and elderly control groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations between clinical and vertical ground reaction force variables.
Findings: Vertical ground reaction force variables were significantly lower on the involved side for the hip fracture group compared to the uninvolved side and controls. Lower involved side hip and knee moments and power contributed to lower involved side vertical ground reaction force. Vertical ground reaction force variables and strength had moderate to high correlations with clinical measures.
Interpretation: Uninvolved side knee moments and powers were the largest contributors to asymmetrical vertical ground reaction force in participants post-hip fracture. The association of vertical ground reaction force variables and clinical measures of function suggesting reducing vertical ground reaction force asymmetry may contribute to higher levels of function post-hip fracture. Functional and strength training should target the involved knee to reduce vertical ground reaction force asymmetry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare lower extremity force applications during a sit-to-stand (STS) task with and without upper extremity assistance in older individuals post-hip fracture to those of age-matched controls.
BACKGROUND: A recent study documented the dependence on upper extremity assistance and the uninvolved lower limb during an STS task in individuals post-hip fracture. This study extends this work by examining the effect of upper extremity assistance on symmetry of lower extremity force applications.
METHODS: Twenty-eight community-dwelling elderly subjects, 14 who had recovered from a hip fracture and 14 controls, participated in the study. All participants were independent ambulators. Four force plates were used to determine lower extremity force applications during an STS task with and without upper extremity assistance. The summed vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs) of both limbs were used to determine STS phases (preparation/rising). The lower extremity force applications were assessed statistically using analysis of variance models.
RESULTS: During the preparation phase, side-to-side symmetry of the rate of force development was significantly lower for the hip fracture group for both STS tasks (P<.001). During the rising phase, the vGRF impulse of the involved limb was significantly lower for the hip fracture group for both STS tasks (P=.045). The vGRF impulse for the uninvolved limb was significantly increased when participants with hip fracture did not use upper extremity assistance compared to elderly controls (P=.002). This resulted in a significantly lower vGRF symmetry for the hip fracture group during both STS tasks (P<.001).
CONCLUSION: Participants with hip fracture who were discharged from rehabilitative care demonstrated decreased side-to-side symmetry of lower extremity loading during an STS task, irrespective of whether upper extremity assistance was provided. These findings suggest that learned motor control strategies may influence movement patterns post-hip fracture. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2012;42(5):474-481. doi:10.2519/jospt.2012.3562},

A homomorphism H --> SO(3) is used such that the unit sphere S-3 subset of H, invariant under the system, is transformed into the rotation group SO(3). The homomorphic image of the system is identical with the dynamics of rotational motion of a rigid body. The equations of motion are completely integrated in the Euler case. To this end Weierstrass' elliptic functions are used. The following goals are achieved within the framework of the method: (a) when representing the algorithms for modelling the dynamics it suffices to use only one chart from the atlas of the phase space manifold, (b) the point in the configuration space of the actual motion lies on the unit sphere, which ensures the best accuracy in numerical procedures, and (c) in the majority of applications the right-hand sides of the equations of perturbed motion depend polynomially on the phase variables, which simplifies the use of computer algebra in analytic theories.

However, reports of the reliability of FTSST in children with cerebral palsy have been scarce. The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate the test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the FTSST and (2) to investigate the correlation between the FTSST and standard functional balance tests in children with cerebral palsy.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three school children aged from 6 to 18 years with Gross motor functional classification system expanded and revised version (GMFCS-E&R) level I to III were recruited. Reliability of the FTSST and concurrent validity between FTSST and Timed up and go test (TUG) and Berg balance scale (BBS) were determined using the Pearson product moment correlation.
RESULTS: The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for test-retest and inter-rater reliability of FTSST were 0.91 and 0.88 respectively. FTSST showed moderate correlation with TUG (r = 0.552, P < 0.01) and with BBS (r = -0.561, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: FTSST is a reliable assessment tool and correlates with functional balance ability tests in children with mild to moderate cerebral palsy.},

   abstract = {The current study aimed to quantify the soft tissue artifacts of selected markers on the thigh and shank, and their effects on the calculated joint center translations, angles and moments of the knee during sit-to-stand. Ten patients with total knee replacements rose from a chair under simultaneous surveillance of a motion capture system, a force-plate and a fluoroscopy system. The "true" poses of the thigh and shank were defined by those of the femoral and tibial components obtained using a three-dimensional fluoroscopy method. The soft tissue artifacts of the skin markers were calculated as their movement relative to the underlying prosthesis components. The joint center translations, angles and moments at the knee were also calculated separately using skin markers and the registered prosthesis poses. Considerable soft tissue artifacts were found, leading to significantly underestimated flexion and internal rotation angles, and extensor moments, but overestimated joint center translations and adduction. The current study provides accurate data of the kinematics and kinetics of total knee replacements during sit-to-stand. The effects of soft tissue artifacts on the calculated joint center translations, angles and moments were also quantified for the first time in the literature. The results may help in developing guidelines for using skin markers and in establishing databases in the biomechanical assessment of sit-to-stand in patients with total knee replacements.

   abstract = {Study Design. A cross-sectional study to examine the sagittal kinematics of spine and lower limb movement during sit-to-stand (STS).
Objective. To describe the sagittal kinematics of the spine and lower limb in healthy older adults during STS from 2 seat heights.
Summary of Background Data. Older adults with age-related changes in the neuromusculoskeletal system are likely to have difficulty in STS. However, little is known about movement of the spinal regions and their interaction with the lower limb during STS, and the effect of seat height.
Methods. Thirty-two healthy older adults aged over 60 years were videotaped performing STS from 2 seat heights. A 2-dimensional video motion analysis system with a revised sagittal model was used to measure angular displacement and velocity for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine, and the lower limb joints.
Results. Concurrent flexion in the hip joint and lumbar spine was accompanied by extension in the thoracic, lower, and upper cervical spine as the trunk leaned forward. After the buttocks lifted off (LO) the chair, the movement interaction in the spine and hip joint was reversed. Some significant age-related changes during STS included downward head tilt at LO, decreased lumbar range of motion, and a large between-participant variation in the movement ratios. Statistically significant differences in the temporal parameters, angular displacement, and velocity were also found when standing from a lower chair.
Conclusion. This study provides a detailed description of STS in healthy older adults, which has implications for rehabilitation of elderly patients who have difficulty with this activity. Clinicians need to be aware of the concurrent contribution of the hip joint and lumbar spine to trunk forward lean, the importance of thoracic extension during the pre-LO phase and the downward gaze at LO in healthy older adults.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the manner in which healthy individuals execute robust whole body movements despite unstable body structure from the perspective of perception-action coupling. Twelve healthy adults performed sit-to-stand (STS) movements under conditions of constrained visual and somatic senses. During this movement, centre of mass (COM) of the body in the anterior-posterior, upward-downward and right-left directions was computed. The conditions of perceptual constraint were set as vision-restricted, somatosensory-restricted, vision- and somatosensory-restricted, and normal conditions. To evaluate COM control under these perceptual constraints, the variability in position and velocity of COM were assessed. The variabilities in COM velocity in the anterior-posterior and upward-downward directions decreased around the lift-off period only when both vision and somatic senses were constrained, whereas the variability of the COM position in the right-left direction increased under the somatosensory-restricted condition. Our findings suggested that control of COM velocity was enhanced in the major moving directions (anterior and upward directions) around the liftoff period during STS when both modalities of perception with regard to postural orientation were constrained. These motor regulations with perceptual constraints facilitate better adaptation to changes in body and environmental situations in daily life. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The postural response after standing was analyzed with the center of foot pressure in the anteroposterior direction. Forward-leaning responses were identified in 78.3% and 63.3% of trials under conditions 1 and 2, respectively. Backward-leaning responses were identified in 93.3% of the trials under condition 3. Response latency (+/- standard deviation) was significantly longer under conditions 1 and 2 than under condition 3 (1: 872 +/- 576, 2: 1026 +/- 542, and 3: 555 +/- 322 ms; ps < 0.05). Sensory information at the standing point might be anticipated based on sensory information received while sitting. Consequently, postural response as a compensatory movement would occur via the sensory reference system within the supraspinal nervous system.},

Thus, the effort: of upper extremities during standing-up is extensive, The aim of the investigation was to study the influence. of the stimulation of ankle plantar flexors and hip extensors on the efficiency of standing-up process.
Spinal cord injuried subject performed raising from sitting to standing position with surface electrical stimulation, Different combinations of stimulated muscle groups were studied. The stimulation amplitude changed with respect to the current phase of the sit-to-stand process. The vertical arm support force was used to divide standing-up into three phases. The handle reaction force vector was assessed by a robot wrist sensor. The body movement was measured with a contactless optical system, The ground and seat reaction force vectors wore determined with force plates. A 3-dimensional model of the human body was used to assess the joint torques.
No considerable differences were observed between the different types of raising, Additional electrodes on hip extensors slid ankle plantar flexors seem not to be justified for daily FES use, Standing-up is a realtively quick ballistic process, It appears that the patient cannot react in time In order to use his stimulated lower extremities to support the standing-up to a larger extent.},

In each particular subject, the optimization criterion which yielded trajectories that best resemble the measured standing-up movement was determined. Since the intact persons used considerably different criteria in choosing the standing-up trajectories than the amputees, the optimal trajectories were computed by minimizing cost functionals (CF) with distinctive structures for each group of individuals. In intact persons, a unique cost functional was found which yielded realistic standing-up manoeuvres. In amputees, subject-specific sets of parameters indicating slightly different preferences in optimizing the effort of particular muscle groups were used. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The times in completing the FTSTS with two foot placements and the three arm positions were recorded by stopwatch. Results. Posterior foot placement led to significantly shorter FTSTS times when compared with normal foot placement in all the 3 arm positions (P <= 0.001). In addition, hands on thigh position led to significantly longer FTSTS times than the augmented arm position (P = 0.014). Conclusion. Our results showed that foot placement and arm position could influence the FTSTS times of individuals with chronic stroke. Standardizing the foot placement and arm position in the test procedure is essential, if FTSTS test is intended to be used repeatedly on the same subject.},

Methods. Twelve, one-hour groups of presentation sessions (Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children conference, May 2014) were included in this study; half were randomly assigned to the intervention group and half to the control group. The intervention group was exposed to an oral PODP at the beginning and middle of the presentations. Researchers performed three counts: beginning (e.g. first 10 min), middle (e.g. 30-40 min), and end (e.g. 50-60 min); each count included the number of individuals in the audience and the number of standing individuals.
Results. A significantly larger proportion of individuals chose to stand during intervention group presentations (16.9 +/- 2.0%) compared to control group presentations (10.5 +/- 1.5%; chi(2) = 7.13; p < 0.05).
Conclusions. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of PODPs at decreasing sedentary behaviour during an academic conference. PODPs are simple, cost-effective interventions that require minimal time commitment, and represent a population health intervention that could reduce sedentary behaviour in a large group setting.

   abstract = {A novel dimensional synthesis technique for solving the mixed exact and approximate motion synthesis problem for planar RR kinematic chains is presented. The methodology uses an analytic representation of the planar RR dyad's rigid body constraint equation in combination with an algebraic geometry formulation of the exact synthesis for three prescribed positions to yield designs that exactly reach the prescribed pick and place positions while approximating an arbitrary number of guiding positions. The result is a dimensional synthesis technique for mixed exact and approximate motion generation for planar RR dyads. A solution dyad may be directly implemented as a 2R open chain or two solution dyads may be combined to form a planar 4R closed chain, also known as a planar four-bar mechanism. The synthesis algorithm utilizes only algebraic geometry and does not require the use of a numerical optimization algorithm or a metric on elements of SE(2); the group of planar displacements. Two implementations of the synthesis algorithm are presented; computational and graphical construction. Moreover, the kinematic inversion of the algorithm is also included. Two examples that demonstrate the synthesis technique are included.},

   abstract = {Objective
The aims of this study were to identify and quantify functional deficits between the involved and the uninvolved limb as early as 1 mo after ACL reconstruction by means of a sit-to-stand movement on two force platforms.
Design
Ground reaction forces were measured in 73 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 47 with patellar tendon autograft and 26 with hamstring tendon autograft (ACL-H), and in 22 controls, who stood up from a seat as fast as possible. Side-to-side limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated for peak force and rate of force development.
Results
The LSI of vertical peak force was 59% in the patellar tendon autograft group and 68% in the ACL-H group, which were both lower than the 95% LSI of the controls (P < 0.001). The LSI of rate of force development was 27% in the patellar tendon autograft group and 48% in the ACL-H group, which were both lower than the 97% LSI of the controls (P < 0.001). After 2 mos, only in the ACL-H group, the LSI of both vertical peak force and rate of force development reached 88% and 80%, respectively, thus approaching the 96% and 92% LSI of the controls.
Conclusions
Sit-to-stand is effective for measuring functional deficits as early as 1 mo after ACL reconstruction. After 2 mos from surgery, the ACL-H group but not the patellar tendon autograft group approached the LSI of the control group, which may be attributed to differences in the graft.},

This eliminates the need for laborious coordinate transformations necessary in the determination of the canonical coordinate systems. It provides for a direct method for the calculation of instantaneous invariants based on information specifying the rigid body motion in any arbitrary task coordinate systems. Explicit equations are presented for instantaneous in variants up to the third order for spatial and spherical motions and up to the fourth order for planar motions. The results provide for a useful tool in design and analysis of mechanisms and motions based on instantaneous invariants. Examples are presented to illustrate the theory.},

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of an elevated chair on STS performance in patients with CP. [Subjects and Methods] Nine CP patients performed STS from a height-adjustable instrumented chair at their natural speed, with the ankle at a 90 degrees angle to the floor. The center-of-pressure (COP) displacement was recorded under the feet. Each foot position was tested at two chair heights corresponding to 100% and 120% of the leg length. The extent and speed of COP were calculated. [Results] The anteroposterior speed and extent of COP were greater with the standard chair than with the elevated chair. The other parameters such as mediolateral speed, extent, and vertical speed of the COP were not different between the two chairs. [Conclusion] These findings suggest that the sway with STS performed from the elevated chair was lesser than that with STS performed from the standard chair. This information will be relevant to clinicians involved in the rehabilitation of CP patients and will help identify factors that influence STS performance.},

Methods: Individuals over 60 and under 35 years old, with no medical, neurological or orthopedic problems participated in this study. Three-dimensional motion analyses of gait, sit-to-stand and upper extremity performance were performed, and results in the two age groups were compared. Results: Compared with the younger cohort, the gait pattern of the elderly included slower velocity, decreased single stance period, decreased maximal knee extension, and decreased ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. On sit-to-stand, the elderly had decreased knee extension angle, minimal knee extension and maximal ankle plantarflexion moment. On hand-at-object, the elderly had reduced maximal angle of shoulder flexion and increased maximal angle of anterior pelvic tilt. On hand-to-head and hand-to-mouth, the elderly had decreased maximal angle of shoulder flexion. Conclusions: The most debilitating motion factors in the elderly were limitation of shoulder flexion and decreased knee extension and ankle plantarflexion. Therapeutic programs for elderly individuals should target maintenance of flexibility and strengthening of ankle plantarflexors, strengthening knee extensors, and maintenance of the shoulder joint ROM.},

This study investigated whether varying angles of knee flexion affect STS patterns in individuals with hemiparesis by using a foot plantar pressure measurement system. [Methods] Fifteen stroke patients with hemiparesis participated for this study. They performed sit-to-stand with three angles of knee flexion (70 degrees, 90 degrees, and 110 degrees). We measured the trajectory of the center of pressure, peak plantar pressure, and symmetry index using a Mat-scan system (Tekscan, South Boston, MA, USA). [Results] As a result, we found that there were significant differences among the three angle conditions (trajectory of center of pressure, peak plantar pressure on the affected side, and symmetry index). However, there was no significant difference in peak pressure according to the knee flexion on the unaffected side. [Conclusion] In the current study, we found that stroke patients with hemiparesis had a compensated STS pattern according to knee flexion angles. This indicates that the peak value of plantar pressure increased and that the trajectory of the center of pressure widened as the angle of knee flexion increased. We also suggest that hemiparesis patients should be more concerned about proper knee angle for symmetrical STS pattern.},

A computerized controlled dynamic postural control assessment system was developed and used in this study. Various dynamic balance indexes were introduced and derived from center of force sway patterns expressed in four domains (space, time, force, and frequency). Motor control was assessed by multichannel surface electromyography of each side of the lower limb during the same motor task. The functional mobility capability was evaluated using the traditional FIM(SM) method. Fourteen stroke patients with right hemiplegia and nine healthy elderly individuals were recruited as the experimental and control groups, respectively. Muscle activity was recorded for quadriceps, hamstrings, anterior tibialis, and triceps surae muscles and was used for analysis. Center of force sway patterns and ground reaction forces were registered. All signals were synchronized at ''seat-off.'' Surface electromyographic patterns of activities recorded during sit-to-stand and dynamic balance indexes computed from center of force sway patterns were categorized and compared with the functional mobility scores. Results show that both the motor control patterns and dynamic balance indexes correlated well to the extent of mobility impairment evaluated using the traditional FIM(SM) method. An important conclusion for rehabilitation medicine is that the functional mobility capability of stroke patients may be expressed numerically using dynamic balance indexes and visualized graphically through electromyographic motor patterns.},

Using an optoelectronic movement analyzer, the smallest compressed angles of the hip and ankle were measured during standing up and sitting down. The adopted strategies had significant effects on the smallest hip-compressed angle, but not the smallest ankle-compressed angle.

In total, 64 elderly volunteers (M age = 80.22, SD = 9.36) were enrolled. Data were obtained from four load cells and a twin-axis wrist goniometer. Wrist deviation and vertical force were examined when participants used a walker with horizontal handles to assist in standing up and sitting down. Significant wrist angle deviation occurred with the use of a walker, with dorsiflexion of the right hand greater than that of the left. Males exerted significantly greater vertical force. In the sitting position, greater ulnar deviation was seen among experienced walker users, whereas during standing, experienced users exhibited greater dorsiflexion. The horizontal handles of most marketed walkers may cause user wrist deviations, suggesting researchers should pursue improvements in walker design.},

Using FDs, a given motion is represented by two finite harmonic series, one for translational component of the motion and the other for rotational component. It is shown that there is a simple linear relationship between harmonic content of the rotational component and that of the translational component for a planar four-bar coupler motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the rotational component of the given motion identifies a subset of design parameters of a four-bar linkage including link ratios, while the translational component determines the rest of the design parameters such as locations of the fixed pivots. This leads naturally to a decomposed design space for four-bar mechanism synthesis for approximate motion generation.},

   abstract = {This paper deals with the classic problem of the synthesis of planar linkages for path generation. Based on the Fourier theory, the task curve and the synthesized four-bar coupler curve are regarded as the same curve if their Fourier descriptors match. Using Fourier analysis, a curve must be given as a function of time, termed a parametrization. In practical applications, different parametrizations can be associated with the same task and coupler curve, respectively; however, these parametrizations are Fourier analyzed to different Fourier descriptors, thus resulting in the mismatch of the task and coupler curve. In this paper, we present a parametrization-invariant method to eliminate the influence of parametrization on the values of Fourier descriptors by unifying given parametrizations to the arc length parametrization; meanwhile, a new design space decoupling scheme is introduced to separate the shape, size, orientation, and location matching of the task and four-bar curve, which leads naturally to an efficient synthesis approach.},

Design: Fifteen children with cerebral palsy and 15 age-matched children with typical development were recruited. They performed sit-to-stand movements while wearing a vest with four different loads (none, low, moderate, and high). Three phases during sit-to-stand and electromyography of vastus lateralis, gluteus maximus, and medial hamstring were recorded.
Results: The ascending phase and peak electromyography of vastus lateralis showed a significant interaction between groups and resistance conditions. The children with cerebral palsy took a longer time to stand up than the control group when the load was high (P = 0.004). The peak electromyography of vastus lateralis increased with increasing resistance in the control group (P < 0.017) but not in children with cerebral palsy. Children with cerebral palsy had a higher cocontraction ratio of the medial hamstring/vastus lateralis than the control group (P = 0.001) at all resistance levels.
Conclusions: Children with cerebral palsy took a longer time for the task but did not increase agonist contraction as the control group in response to higher loads. Future research is suggested to see whether agonist contraction will be improved with strengthening therapy.},

Design: A single-blind, randomized block design.
Setting: STS exercises were carried out at the children's homes.
Participants: Twenty children (12 boys, 8 girls; age range, 5-12y) with spastic diplegia CP and classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System as level I or II were stratified by their severity and age and randomly allocated into either the experimental or control group.
Intervention: Both groups received their regular physical therapy. The experimental group underwent loaded STS exercise 3 times a week for 6 weeks.
Main Outcome Measures: Goal dimension scores of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), gait speed, 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) of the loaded STS, isometric strength of knee extensor, and Physiological Cost Index (PCI). The outcome measures were conducted at the beginning and end of the 6-week study.
Results: After loaded STS exercise, the experimental group showed statistically significant differences in GMFM goal dimension scores, 1-RM STS, and PCI from the control group. The changes in gait speed and isometric strength of the knee extensor did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
Conclusions: After the loaded STS exercise, children with mild spastic diplegia improved their basic motor abilities, functional muscle strength, and walking efficiency.},

   abstract = {We propose here a new universal parametrization for B-spline interpolation. The new parametrization is based on the values t(i) where B-splines N-i,N-k(t) are maximum in case of order k. The resulting interpolation curve X(t) is transformation invariant and more natural looking, in general, than those obtained by other methods. Using a fixed knot vector, ti's are independent of interpolating points {P-i}, and hence the computation of X(t) can be done more efficiently. In addition, the new method works well in any order k.

   abstract = {Power has been demonstrated to be an early and potent marker of frailty. The measurements currently available are tied to locality. Usually, measurements include single joint movements or movements of only the legs and the resistance is not adjusted for body weight. In this study, a portable method to measure power in the sit-to-stand transfer was developed and tested. Mean power was calculated from the vertical ground reaction force of body weight, the difference between height in a sitting and in an upright position and the time taken to stand up. The results of this power measurement were compared with an isokinetic force measurement, the "Nottingham power rig", and measurement of physical performance in a five-repetition chair rise (five-chair rise). A convenience sample of 33 healthy elderly subjects [mean (SD) age: 67.8 (6.7) years; 17 men, 16 women] was included. Measurement of power during the sit-to-stand transfer showed good correlation to isokinetic force measurement (r=0.68) and to the "Nottingham power rig" (r=0.6). Correlation to five-chair rise was poor (r=-0.08). In conclusion, the study shows that the method presented is able to measure power during performance of a daily task. The poor correlation between the introduced measurement and the five-chair rise suggests that it might be able to detect decline in muscle function earlier by the introduced measurement than by measurement of the functional status. As it is inexpensive and portable, its use in clinical practice and research contexts, including home-bound individuals, is feasible.},

Design Cross-sectional study.
Setting Movement laboratory of a geriatric rehabilitation clinic.
Participants Eighty-eight community-dwelling, cognitively unimpaired older women (mean age 78 years).
Main outcome measures Sit-to-stand performance power and leg power were assessed using a linear encoder and the Nottingham Power Rig, respectively. Gait speed was measured on an instrumented walkway. Maximum quadriceps and hand grip strength were assessed using dynamometers. Mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area of both legs was measured using magnetic resonance imaging.
Results Associations of sit-to-stand performance power with power assessed by the Nottingham Power Rig, maximum gait speed and muscle cross-sectional area were r=0.646, r=0.536 and r=0.514, respectively. A linear regression model explained 50% of the variance in sit-to-stand performance power including muscle cross-sectional area (p = 0.001), maximum gait speed (p = 0.002), and power assessed by the Nottingham Power Rig (p = 0.006).
Conclusions Construct validity of linear encoder measurement of sit-to-stand power was shown at functional level and morphological level for older women. This measure could be used in routine clinical practice as well as in large-scale studies. (C) 2015 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study was to investigate the effect of bed height and use of hands on trunk angular velocity and trunk angles during the sit-to-stand (STS) performance. Twenty-four older persons (median age 74 years) were equipped with a body-fixed gyroscopic sensor and stood up from a bed adjusted to different heights, with and without the use of hands at each height. Peak angular velocity and trunk range of motion decreased with increasing bed height (all p <= 0.038) and were lower using hands during STS transfer indicating less effort. In conclusion, gyroscopic sensor data of the STS transfer of older persons show differences as an effect of bed height and use of hands. These results provide the rationale for recommending a relatively high bed height for most of the older persons.
Practitioner Summary: To minimise the effort during sit-to-stand transfer performance from bed, it is necessary to understand the effect of bed height and use of hands. It is concluded that a relatively high bed height and the use of hands is helpful for most of the older persons during sit-to-stand transfer.},

In this study, geometries of the generators are represented by natural quadric Surfaces (planes, circular cylinders, circular cones and spheres). Meanwhile, the instantaneous screw axis is used to describe the sweep motion of the generators and to aid the construction of their swept volumes. A closed formed solution to determine the points on the boundary of a swept volume at a specific time is developed for each of the generators. A point set which contains these points is called the characteristic curve. The final swept volume of a generator is a faceted model from a set of characteristic curves at different time steps over a time domain within which it moves. In this paper, the application of swept volumes in the geometric design of spatial mechanisms is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A motion analysis system and two force plates measured STS duration and weight-bearing symmetry (determined by ground reaction forces) during three self-paced and three fast-paced conditions. An isokinetic dynamometer measured maximum concentric joint torques of the paretic and non-paretic ankle, knee, and hip, which were normalized by body mass. Pearson correlations indicated that (a) paretic ankle dorsiflexion and knee extension torques related to the duration of the self-paced STS condition (r = -0.450, -0.716, respectively), (b) paretic ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, and knee extension torques related to the duration of the fast-paced STS condition (r = -0.466, -0.616, -0.736, respectively), and (c) greater weight-bearing symmetry related to faster STS performance for both self-paced and fast-paced STS conditions (r = -0.565, -0.564, respectively) (P < 0.05). This evidence suggests that paretic muscle strength and the ability to load the paretic limb are important factors underlying the ability to rise from a chair in individuals with chronic stroke.

   abstract = {Background. Sit-to-stand (STS) performance is often used as a measure of lower-limb strength in older people and those with significant weakness. However, the findings of recent studies suggest that performance in this test is also influenced by factors associated with balance and mobility. We conducted a study to determine whether sensorimotor, balance, and psychological factors in addition to lower-limb strength predict sit-to-stand performance in older people.
Methods. Six hundred and sixty nine community-dwelling men and women aged 75-93 years (mean age 78.9, SD = 4.1) underwent quantitative tests of strength, vision, peripheral sensation, reaction time, balance, health status, and sit-to-stand performance.
Results. Many physiological and psychological factors were significantly associated with sit-to-stand times in univariate analyses. Multiple regression analysis revealed that visual contrast sensitivity, lower limb proprioception, peripheral tactile sensitivity, reaction time involving a foot-press response, sway with eyes open on a foam rubber mat, body weight, and scores on the Short-Form 12 Health Status Questionnaire pain, anxiety, and vitality scales in addition to knee extension, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion strength were significant and independent predictors of STS performance. Of these measures, quadriceps strength had the highest beta weight, indicating it was the most important variable in explaining the variance in STS times. However, the remaining measures accounted for more than half the explained variance in STS times. The final regression model explained 34.9% of the variance in STS times (multiple R = .59).
Conclusions. The findings indicate that, in community-dwelling older people, STS performance is influenced by multiple physiological and psychological processes and represents a particular transfer skill, rather than a proxy measure of lower limb strength.},

Design. Relative body joint position and ground reaction forces were measured by a motion analysis system and one force plate.
Background. Physiological and psychological changes during pregnancy impose postural demands and limit the performance of daily living activities such as rising from sitting to standing position.
Methods. Twenty-four pregnant women, divided into three groups, were studied performing sit-to-stand transition from an armless and adjustable chair. By kinematic and kinetic analysis, the angles and moments of hip, knee and ankle joints were investigated.
Results. The chair height has great influence on knee joint and hip joint moments, but less on ankle joints. In the third trimester for all chair heights, because of a marked increase in abdominal depth, the maximum hip moment is significantly less than that in first trimester, while the maximum knee moment is significantly larger. Pregnant women in third trimester produced larger knee moment during sit-to-stand transition from lower chair height.
Conclusion. The mechanism of sit-to-stand is affected by the physical changes of pregnant women at different periods of pregnancy, e.g. increased loading of knee joint and decreased hip joint moment, especially in the last trimester period of pregnancy.},

Two force plates and a motion analysis system were used to determine peak joint moments at the ankles, knees, and hips following liftoff from a chair. Statistically, bilateral asymmetries in peak joint moments were found at the knee joint in the young group [a right to left difference of 0.43 %BW x BH (body weight x body height)] and at the hip joint in both subject groups (differences of 0.20 %BW x BH and 1.09 %BW x BH for the young and elderly subjects, respectively). Subsequent data analysis, using an algorithm that assumed bilateral ground reaction force (GRF) symmetry, was performed to determine whether the bilateral differences were a result of kinematic or GRF asymmetry. It was concluded from these results that both the kinematic and GRF data account for the bilateral asymmetry. The results of the subsequent analysis also showed that the method which assumed bilateral GRF symmetry underestimated the peak joint moments at the ankles, knees, and hips, with the greatest difference between methods being 0.10 %BW x BH for the ankle joint. The results of this study suggest that the assumption of bilateral symmetry of lower extremity joint moments during the sit-to-stand is not valid. However, the biomechanical significance of the errors associated with assuming symmetry must also be taken into account. Studies involving the sit-to-stand task should consider the effects of asymmetry on the interpretation and application of their results.},

This study determined the extent to which maximum trunk flexion angle during a self-paced sit-to-stand from a standardized initial position was influenced by the maximum isometric strength of the knee and trunk/hip extensor muscles in older adults. The hypothesis was mat the larger maximum trunk flexion angle attained by older adults when rising from a chair is related to the maximum isometric strength of the knee and trunk-hip extensor muscles. To test this hypothesis, maximum voluntary isometric strength of the trunk extensor and knee extensor muscles of 28 older men and women were measured. Trunk motion during the sit-to-stand by these adults was then assessed using motion analysis. Multiple regression was used to characterize the relationship between the maximum trunk flexion angle and maximum isometric knee extensor and trunk extensor muscle strength. The derived relationship was neither statistically significant nor biomechanically meaningful. This result suggests that the trunk flexion angle attained by healthy older adults when rising from a chair from a standardized initial position is not influenced by knee extension and trunk-hip extension strength as measured in the present study.},

   abstract = {Many Virtual Reality (VR) applications have been successfully developed in different fields such as medicine, military, design and manufacturing. Most of these applications involve the moving of objects and their interaction with the environment in virtual space. One of the foreseeable important applications of virtual manufacturing is the Numerically Controlled (NC) machining generation paths and verification in a VR environment for rapid prototyping. The user manipulates a cutting tool in virtual environment to guide the machine in cutting a specified object. This application requires the complexity of full-body haptics, since machine tool geometry must be accurately modeled in the simulation to capture the geometric interaction between the cutting tool and the target creation. Also, these kinds of applications require an efficient computation of swept volumes of the machining tool geometry to achieve real-time rendering of the machining processes in the VR setting.This paper describes a fast and accurate method for generating the swept volume of a moving object undergoing an arbitrary translational and rotational motion, with application to NC machining simulation in a VR setting. The Sweep Differential Equation (SDE) method, which was initially developed for representing and computing the swept volumes of rigid moving objects and subsequently extended to objects that may deform during the course of motion, forms the basis for the VR application of NC cutter path generation and verification. An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SDE method for simulation of multi-axis NC machining.},

   abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to manifest slowness in movements. We sought to identify the particular kinematic and kinetic disorders that contribute to the slowness in performing sit-to-stand in these patients. Two interrelated studies were carried out. In the first study, 20 patients with PD and 20 control subjects were instructed to perform sit-to-stand at a natural speed. In the second study, 15 control subjects were instructed to simulate the slower speed of sit-to-stand of the patients identified in the first study. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded by a PEAK motion analysis system and two force platforms. The results showed that patients with PD generated smaller peak horizontal and vertical velocities during the task. They took a longer time to complete each individual phase as well as the whole movement of sit-to-stand. Patients also produced smaller peak hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion joint torques and had prolonged time-to-peak torques from sit-to-stand onset. When control subjects simulated the patients' speed of sit-to-stand, there was no difference in all the kinematic and kinetic data between groups. The only exception was that they exhibited a shorter transition time between peak horizontal velocity (flexion phase) and seat-off (extension phase) than the patients. This study demonstrated that the slowness of PD patients during sit-to-stand at a natural speed could be attributed to inadequate peak hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion torques, a prolonged torque production, as well as a difficulty in switching from the flexion to extension direction during sit-to-stand. As the latter difficulty persisted when the control subjects performed the task at a speed similar to that of the patients, our findings suggest that a fundamental problem of patients with Parkinson's disease could be a switch between movement directions.

   abstract = {We investigated whether preparatory signals, in the form of audiovisual cues, could enhance the performance of sit-to-stand (STS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Fifteen patients and fifteen control subjects similar in age, gender, weight, and height were examined. All subjects were instructed to carry out STS under self-initiated and cue-initiated conditions. A PEAK Motion Analysis System and two force plates were synchronized to record kinematic and kinetic data. In patients with PD, the addition of audiovisual cues was found to increase hip flexion and knee extension torques and decrease the time-to-peak joint torques, as well as increase peak horizontal and vertical velocities of the body center of mass and decrease the time taken to complete STS. Consequently, the performance of STS in these patients approached that of control subjects. In fact, during cue-initiated STS, no difference was found between the patient and control groups for the time-to-peak of all joint torques, the peak horizontal and vertical velocities, and the time taken to complete STS. Our findings thus demonstrated that audiovisual cues were effective in enhancing STS in patients with PD. These feed-forward signals could have enhanced the defective motor preparatory phase, thus leading to improved performance of the STS task. These findings provide a scientific basis for the use of audiovisual signals to enhance STS performance in patients with PD. (C) 2004 Movement Disorder Society.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate whether Parkinsonian patients could modify the speed of a sit-to-stand (STS) task to the same extent as that of healthy subjects.
Methods: Twenty Parkinsonian patients and 20 control subjects were instructed to stand up at a natural and fast speed. Kinematic data and kinetic data were recorded.
Results: Parkinsonian patients were significantly slower than healthy individuals during STS at a natural speed. When required to perform STS task at a fast speed, these patients could increase both peak horizontal and vertical velocities of the task, by significantly increasing hip and ankle dorsiflexion torques and the rate of torque production, just as the control subjects did. In fact, no difference was found for the percentage changes in both peak velocities and movement time between the two groups, though similar between-group differences during STS at a natural speed still existed at a fast speed.
Conclusions: Parkinsonian patients had problems in generating adequate lower limb joint torques and in the rate of torque production when performing STS at a natural speed. However, these patients were capable of increasing the speed of their STS with the same percentage changes as those of healthy subjects.
Significance: The capability of Parkinsonian patients for increasing movement speed gives new insights to rehabilitation strategy. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Fifty-two Subjects with PD completed the study. They were randomly allocated to receive 4 weeks of AV cued task-specific training, conventional exercise (Ex), or no treatment (control). Each Subject was assessed before, at the end of 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks after treatment ended. After 2 weeks of training, the AV group significantly increased the peak horizontal velocity (by 13%, P<0.01) when compared with the Ex group. After 4 weeks of training, AV group increased both peak horizontal and vertical velocities, respectively by 18% and 51%, and reduced the time taken to complete STS by 25%. These improvements were greater than those of the Ex group, who showed 8% (nonsignificant between-group) and 20% (P<0.05 between-group) increases respectively for peak horizontal and vertical velocities, and 10% decrease in movement time (P<0.05). Worth-noting is the improvements in AV group could be carried over to 2 weeks after treatment ended.

Design. A cross-sectional study utilizing a Parkinsonian and a control group.
Background. Subjects with Parkinson's disease were observed to experience difficulty in performing sit-to-stand. The developed model was used to calculate the lower limb joint torques in normal elderly subjects and subjects with Parkinson's disease, to delineate possible causes underlying difficulties in initiating sit-to-stand task.
Methods. Six normal elderly subjects and seven age-matched subjects with Parkinson's disease performed five sit-to-stand trials at their self-selected speed. Anthropometric data, two-dimensional kinematic and foot-ground and thigh-chair reactive forces were used to calculate, via inverse dynamics, the joint torques during sit-to-stand in both before and after seat-off phases. The difference between the control and Parkinson's disease group was analysed using independent t-tests.
Results. Both control and Parkinson's disease groups had a similar joint kinematic pattern, although the Parkinson's disease group demonstrated a slower angular displacement. The latter subjects produced significantly smaller normalized hip flexion torque and presented a slower torque build-up rate than the able-bodied subjects (P < 0.05).
Conclusion. Slowness of sit-to-stand in people with Parkinson's disease could be due to a reduced hip flexion joint torque and a prolonged rate of torque production. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. Previous studies focused on describing successful sit-to-stand (STS) performance in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Little is known about why these patients fail to perform this transfer activity.
Objective. This study aimed to determine the role of dynamic stability and limb support in governing successful STS performance in patients with PD and to determine the limits of recovery for discriminating between successful and failed STS trials.
Design. This was a cross-sectional study.
Methods. Twenty-eight patients with PD were instructed to perform the STS task. Kinematic data on 18 successful trials and 14 failed trials (when the patients fell backward) were collected with a motion analysis system. Dynamic stability was determined by the anteroposterior position of the body's center of mass (COM) relative to the base of support (BOS) and by the anteroposterior velocity of the COM relative to the BOS (Velocity(COM/BOS,AP)). Limb support was characterized by the hip height (Height(hip)).
Results. The findings revealed no between-group ("risers" versus "fallers") differences in dynamic stability. The fallers shifted their COM in a significantly more anterior position to compensate for their lower Velocity(COM/BOS,AP) at seat-off. It was in the vertical direction that the fallers had significantly reduced peak COM velocity (Velocity(COM,vertical)) and lower corresponding Height(hip) than the risers. Results of a stepwise regression model showed that Velocity(COM/BOS,AP) and Height(hip) at the instant of peak Velocity(COM,vertical) could best predict the STS outcome (success versus failure), with an overall prediction accuracy of 87.5%. The limit differentiating successful from failed STS trials was: Height(hip)=-0.814 Velocity(COM/BOS,AP) + 0.463.
Limitations. All of the patients were community dwelling and had a moderate level of disease severity. The results cannot be generalized to those who are institutionalized or with advanced PD.
Conclusions. Limb support and ill-timed peak forward COM velocity, rather than dynamic stability, play the dominant roles in determining successful STS performance in patients with PD.},

During sit-to-stand, Alzheimer's disease subjects reduced their forward displacement and started their upward displacement earlier than healthy elderly subjects. Furthermore, shoulder path curvatures were more pronounced for upward compared with downward displacement in healthy elderly group, in contrast with Alzheimer's disease group. Temporal analysis found that: 1) for both groups, profiles of velocity of sit-to-stand and back-to-sit showed two peaks corresponding respectively to forward/upward and to downward/backward displacements, 2) peaks of velocity were almost comparable between the two groups, 3) duration of sit-to-stand was shorter than duration of back-to-sit in the two groups and 4) duration of sit-to-stand and back-to-sit was shorter in Alzheimer's disease group than in healthy elderly group. However, dissimilarities were observed for transition and deceleration phases during sit-to-stand, and for acceleration and transition phases during back-to-sit, between the two groups. Interestingly, while sit-to-stand and back-to-sit differed in healthy elderly subjects during transition and deceleration phases, such a difference was not observed for Alzheimer's disease subjects. So, our study showed that invariant spatio-temporal movement parameters in the two groups differed, while non-invariant parameters did not, and suggests that higher level motor process of whole body motions are affected by Alzheimer's disease, while lower level motor features remain intact.

   abstract = {Purpose
Sit-to-stand workstations are becoming common in modern offices and are increasingly being implemented in sedentary behavior interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the introduction of such a workstation among office workers leads to reductions in sitting during working hours, and whether office workers compensate for any reduction in sitting at work by increasing sedentary time and decreasing physical activity (PA) outside work.
Methods
Office workers (n = 40; 55% female) were given a WorkFit-S, sit-to-stand workstation for 3 months. Participants completed assessments at baseline (before workstation installation), 1 wk and 6 wk after the introduction of the workstation, and again at 3 months (postintervention). Posture and PA were assessed using the activPAL inclinometer and ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer, which participants wore for 7 d during each measurement phase.
Results
Compared with baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly decreased (75% +/- 13% vs 52% +/- 16% to 56% +/- 13%), and time spent standing and in light activity significantly increased (standing: 19% +/- 12% vs 32% +/- 12% to 37% +/- 15%, light PA: 14% +/- 4% vs 16% +/- 5%) during working hours at all follow-up assessments. However, compared with baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly increased (60% +/- 11% vs 66% +/- 12% to 68% +/- 12%) and light activity significantly decreased (21% +/- 5% vs 19% +/- 5%) during nonworking hours across the follow-up measurements. No differences were seen in moderate-to-vigorous activity during nonworking hours throughout the study.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that introducing a sit-to-stand workstation can significantly reduce sedentary time and increase light activity levels during working hours. However, these changes were compensated for by reducing activity and increasing sitting outside of working hours. An intervention of a sit-to-stand workstation should be accompanied by an intervention outside of working hours to limit behavior compensation.},

The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is an objective performance-based task, whose assessment is related with the evaluation of functional recovery. Twenty two patients with hip osteoarthritis participated in this study. For each patient, validated questionnaires were administered and gait velocity was measured. Time, ground reaction forces, and lower limb asymmetry parameters were calculated using the instrumented force shoes (IFS) during STS movement with and without armrest. Significant inter-limb asymmetry was observed. No correlation was found between any parameter and gait velocity and questionnaires outcomes. Significant differences in time and force parameters between with/without armrest were found. Concluding, inter-limb asymmetry can be evaluated with the IFS supplying important additional information not represented by gait velocity and questionnaires usually used.},

   abstract = {Objective. Sit-to-stand tasks are commonly facilitated by modifying the initial position of the center of mass relative to the feet. It was hypothesized that modifications in the center of mass trajectory during sit-to-stand tasks altered the total body momentum at seat departure and redistributed the lower extremity net joint moments.
Design. Between-task within-subject comparison was employed using a robust statistical method to accommodate for small sample size.
Methods. Six individuals performed four sit-to-stand tasks with systematic modifications in the initial center of mass position by varying the orientation of the lower extremity segments. The momentum of the center of mass and lower extremity net joint moments were quantified and compared.
Results. Reducing the horizontal center of mass displacement significantly reduced horizontal total body momentum required at seat departure. Sit-to-stand tasks initiated with more horizontal shank and thigh positions required significantly greater knee and hip extensor net joint moments than those with more vertical shank and thigh positions. Sit-to-stand tasks initiated with vertical shank positions also required significantly greater hip extensor net joint moments as compared to those with more horizontal shank orientations.
Interpretation. When changes in initial center of mass position are made, alteration in center of mass horizontal momentum and the orientation of the lower extremity segments relative to the reaction force are observed. Consequently, mechanical demand imposed on the ankle, knee, and hip joint is redistributed. The magnitude of the net joint moments is dependent on the segment orientation, the reaction force, and the adjacent net joint moment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Current recommendations relating to the treatment of acetabular fractures are based on studies that evaluate the loading patterns associated with normal gait despite the fact that the forces on the acetabulum are significantly greater during sit-to-stand activities. We hypothesize that this increased force will lead to greater instability when an acetabular fracture occurs, and our goal was to compare cadaveric hip stability during single-leg-stance (SLS) and sit-to-stand (STS) maneuvers using a transverse acetabular fracture model.
Methods: Seven fresh-frozen cadaveric hemipelvic specimens with proximal femurs were dissected of all soft tissues. Transverse acetabular osteotomies were created in 5-mm increments from distal to proximal. The roof arc angle and decrease of articular surface area were measured after each osteotomy, and the specimens were tested in SLS and STS. A 1200-N load was applied and visible dislocation was recorded for each loading orientation.
Results: The average roof arc angle needed to dislocate in the SLS position was 46.1 degrees in the anteroposterior, 71.9 degrees in the iliac oblique, and 25.2 degrees in the obturator oblique views compared with 90.9 degrees in anteroposterior, 101.4 degrees in iliac oblique, and 67.3 degrees in obturator oblique views for the STS orientation (P < 0.003 for all radiographic views). The decrease in articular surface area needed to dislocate the hip was significantly less for the STS group (10.9%) than the SLS group (36.4%) (P = 0.003).
Conclusions: There is significantly greater hip instability seen with STS loading of a transverse acetabular model than with simple SLS loading. This would suggest that some fractures previously deemed stable may show significant instability during common activities of daily living, and reassessment of nonoperative treatment may be indicated.},

Design: Cross-sectional study.
Settings: Rehabilitation unit of the Istituto Nazionale Riposo e Cura Anziani Geriatric Hospital of Florence, Italy.
Participants: A convenience sample (131 subjects) of the outpatient clinic and day-hospital population.
Measurements: A performance-based test (repeated chair standing) was used to divide the subjects into five functional groups. Subjects performed a series of single STS tasks across a range of five descending seat heights. They were instructed to stand without using arms or compensatory strategies. If unable, swinging the arms was allowed, and if the inability persisted, subjects could push with their arms during subsequent attempts. The strategy or inability to stand formed the dependent measures.
Results: Subjects within the two highest functional groups could complete the single STS task at all seat heights, with a slight increased use of compensatory strategies at the lowest seat height. The effectiveness of the compensatory strategies decreased rapidly as a function of seat height and functional status. One-third (35.5%) of the subjects in the middle functional group swung their arms at the lower seat heights. Across the three least functional groups, 11.8%, 30.6%, and 83.3% of the subjects, respectively, were unable to stand at the lowest seat height.
Conclusion: The individual's functional status and difficulty of the task influenced the effectiveness of a compensatory strategy to maintain the ability to stand, supporting the idea that disability depends on the interplay between environmental demands and physical ability.},

Design: Single group, observational.
Setting: Institutional settings in the United States and Italy.
Participants: Twenty-nine subjects with chronic unilateral lower-limb impairments and resultant mobility limitations secondary to stroke.
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures: Manual measurement of lower-limb strength; performance-based tests including repeated chair standing, walking speed, and standing balance; and ground reactions measured with a force platform during STS and upright posture. The ground reactions were fed to a telescopic inverted pendulum model of the musculoskeletal system. Parameters representing the model outputs were compared with performance-based and strength measures to assess, respectively, motor ability and impairment-related changes in subjects motor strategies.
Results: The parameters derived from the model effectively differentiated between motor strategies associated with different performance-based scores, and allowed the identification of relevant difficulties encountered in STS execution. These difficulties could be associated with different strength scores. This was also true for subjects scoring the maximum in both performance-based and strength tests.
Conclusions: The MMIM is a relatively inexpensive and noninvasive approach that enhances mobility assessment of hemiparetic subjects with different motor ability levels. It provides information that correlates well with performance-based and strength scores and, in addition, it allows for subject-specific motor strategy identification.},

   abstract = {The identification of quantitative tools to assess an individual's mobility limitation is a complex and challenging task. Several motor tasks have been designated as potential indicators of mobility limitation. In this study, a multiple motor task obtained by sequencing sit-to-stand and upright posture was used. Algorithms based on data obtained exclusively from a single force platform were developed to detect the timing of the motor task phases (sit-to-stand, preparation to the upright posture and upright posture). To test these algorithms, an experimental protocol inducing predictable changes in the acquired signals was designed. Twenty-two young, able-bodied subjects performed the task in four different conditions: self-selected natural and high speed with feet kept together, and self-selected natural and high speed with feet pelvis-width apart.
The proposed algorithms effectively detected the timing of the task phases, the duration of which was sensitive to the four different experimental conditions. As expected, the duration of the sit-to-stand was sensitive to the speed of the task and not to the foot position, while the duration of the preparation to the upright posture was sensitive to foot position but not to speed.
In addition to providing a simple and effective description of the execution of the motor task, the correct timing of the studied multiple task could facilitate the accurate determination of variables descriptive of the single isolated phases, allowing for a more thorough description of the motor task and therefore could contribute to the development of effective quantitative functional evaluation tests.

This article presents the results of a longitudinal study of the development of coordination patterns for this task and on the effect of changing an environmental constraint on the manifestation of that coordination. Five female infants who were just beginning to independently stand up from a seat were studied over 18 weeks. The infants used two relatively distinct patterns of movement to complete the task. The dominant pattern differed across weeks of development and between two seat heights. Relative differences in the contributions of the shank and trunk to the momentum of the body's center of mass, and differences in relative timing between the peak momenta of the shank, thigh and trunk, were shown to differentiate between the two movement patterns. Kinematic relative timing variables were also analyzed, but only the relative onset of knee extension with respect to the trunk cycle clearly distinguished between the two movement patterns. Further studies are needed to assess the roles of various factors (e.g., learning, muscle strength, mass distribution changes) in the performance of this task during development.

   abstract = {Background: A study was conducted to determine the reliability and validity of a new foot mobility assessment method that utilizes digital images to measure the change in dorsal arch height measured at 50% of the length of the foot during the Sit-to-Stand test.
Methods: Two hundred - seventy five healthy participants participated in the study. The medial aspect of each foot was photographed with a digital camera while each participant stood with 50% body weight on each foot as well as in sitting for a non-weight bearing image. The dorsal arch height was measured at 50% of the total length of the foot on both weight bearing and non-weight bearing images to determine the change in dorsal arch height. The reliability and validity of the measurements were then determined.
Results: The mean difference in dorsal arch height between non-weight bearing and weight bearing was 10 millimeters. The change in arch height during the Sit-to-Stand test was shown to have good to high levels of intra-and inter-reliability as well as validity using x-rays as the criterion measure.
Conclusion: While the navicular drop test has been widely used as a clinical method to assess foot mobility, poor levels of inter-rater reliability have been reported. The results of the current study suggest that the change in dorsal arch height during the Sit-to-Stand test offers the clinician a reliable and valid alternative to the navicular drop test.},

The results revealed that LBPs could stabilize the CM and head positions same as controls. Also there was more than 1 synergic combination of whole body segments in both LBP and healthy groups. But the number of PCs accounting for the major part of variance was reduced in the LBPs in the most unstable phase of movement (50%-80% trajectory) in the RO and RC conditions.

Measuring ground reaction force is a simple method of collecting information on joint loading during a sit-to-stand (STS). We investigated vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) asymmetry during sit-to-stand for 12 MoMHRA patients with known serum metal ion levels. Asymmetry was assessed using two methods: a ratio of VGRF for implanted/unimplanted side and an absolute symmetry index (ASI). It was found that subjects with high serum metal ion levels preferentially loaded their implanted sides. The difference between the two groups was most apparent during the first 22% of STS. VGRF ratio showed significant and strong correlation with serum metal ion levels (Spearman's rho = 0.8, p = 0.003). These results suggest that individual activity patterns play a role in the wear of MoMHRA and preferential loading of an implanted limb during the initiation of motion may increase the wear of metal-on-metal hip replacements.},

The purpose of this study was to examine patient activity patterns and their influence on acetabular component edge loading in a group of subjects with known serum metal ion levels. Fifteen subjects with metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (eight males and seven females) were recruited for motion analysis followed by computed tomography scans. They were divided into three groups based on their serum metal ion levels and the orientation of their acetabular component: well-positioned acetabular component with low metal ions, mal-positioned acetabular component with low metal ions and mal-positioned acetabular component with high ions. A combination of motion analysis, subject-specific modelling (AnyBody Modeling System, Aalborg, Denmark) and computed tomography measurements was used to calculate dynamically the contact patch-to-rim distance for each subject during gait and sit-to-stand. The contact-pitch-to-rim distance for the high ion group was significantly lower (p<0.001) than for the two low ion groups (well-positioned and mal-positioned) during the stance phase of gait (0%-60%) and loading phase of sit-to-stand (20%-80%). The results of this study, in particular, the significant difference between the two mal-positioned groups, suggest that wear of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty is not only affected by acetabular cup orientation but also influenced by individual patient activity patterns.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with balance and vestibular disorders would demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement in the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST) score as a result of vestibular rehabilitation and to determine the concurrent validity of the FTSST. Design: Retrospective chart review of 351 people who underwent individualized outpatient vestibular rehabilitation programs. Setting: Outpatient tertiary balance and vestibular clinic. Subjects: One hundred and seventeen patients (45 men, 72 women), mean age 62.7 years, with peripheral, central or mixed vestibular dysfunction. Main Outcome Measures: FTSST, gait speed, Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), and Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). Results: The mean change in FTSST score was 2.7 seconds. Subjects demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the FTSST, gait speed, ABC, DHI, DGI and TUG after vestibular rehabilitation (p < 0.01). The responsiveness-treatment coefficient (RT) was calculated as 0.58 for the FTSST indicating moderate responsiveness. Logistic regression showed that an improvement in the FTSST of greater than 2.3 seconds resulted in an odds ratio of 4.67 for demonstrating clinical improvement in DHI, compared with a change less than 2.3 seconds. The univariate linear regression model for baseline FTSST predicting FTSST change was significant (p < 0.01) and predicted 49% of the change variance. The FTSST scores demonstrated a moderate correlation with gait speed and the TUG (p < 0.01). FTSST improvement subsequent to vestibular rehabilitation was moderately correlated with improvements in the DGI and the TUG scores (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The FTSST was moderately responsive to change over time and was moderately related to measures of gait and dynamic balance.},

   abstract = {Background: The 6-min walking test (6MWT) is one of the most commonly used tests to assess exercise capacity during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it is a relatively time-consuming test. Many authors assessed the usefulness of simpler methods, as the sit-to-stand test (STST), to estimate exercise capacity. Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of STST, in comparison to 6MWT, for the evaluation of functional status in Tunisian COPD patients and evaluate its correlation to the severity of the disease. Methods: We studied patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease A-D). All patients had plethysmography and manual quadriceps femoris muscle strength evaluation. Each patient completed a 6MWT and a STST. During the tests, dyspnea severity (Borg scale), heart rate, pulsed oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were measured. Results: In 49 patients with stable COPD (mean age 67.06 8.4 years, mean forced expiratory volume in the first second 46.25% 19.64%), 6MWT and STST were correlated with each other (r = 0.47, P = 0.001). During 6MWT and STST, the rise in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and severity of dyspnea were statistically significant compared to baseline (P < 0.05). However, cardiorespiratory stress was lower after STST than after 6MWT (P < 0.05). A statistically significant positive correlation was noted between the 6MWT distance and forced vital capacity (r = 0.357, P < 0.05). The 6MWT was negatively correlated with dyspnea severity at baseline (r = 0.289, P < 0.05) and with BODE index (r = 0.672, P < 0.01). STST was correlated only with age (r = 0.377, P < 0.01). No correlation was found between both tests and quadriceps femoris strength. Conclusion: As like as 6MWT, STST can determine functional status during COPD. In addition, it is less time consuming and produces less hemodynamical stress compared to 6MWT. STST can be used as an alternative for 6MWT in patients with COPD.},

Kinematic data collected by video, muscle activity monitored by surface electromyography, and ground reaction forces analyzed by a piezoelectric force plate were used for analysis.  Using these synchronized data, three phases of the sit-to-stand motion were identified-phase 1, weight shift; phase 2, transition; and phase 3, lift.  A consistent pattern of trunk and lower extremity motion was observed, and two distinct upper extremity movement strategies were identified.  The onset of muscle activity occurred in the following order:  erector spinae, rectus femoris, and vastus medialis (phase 1); biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, and rectus abdominus (phase 2).  This characterization of the sit-to-stand motion for a small population of healthy elderly subjects serves as a basis for identifying problems in elderly patients who demonstrate difficulty getting up from a chair.},

However, the outcomes are usually more qualitative than quantitative and subtle differences are not detectable. In this review, we aim to assess the role of body motion sensors in physical performance evaluation, especially for the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions. In total, 53 full papers and conference abstracts on related topics were included and 16 different parameters related to transition performance were identified as potentially meaningful to explain certain disabilities and impairments. Transition duration is the most used to evaluate chair-related tests in real clinical settings. High-fall-risk fallers and frail subjects presented longer and more variable transition duration. Other kinematic parameters have also been highlighted in the literature as potential means to detect age-related impairments. In particular, vertical linear velocity and trunk tilt range were able to differentiate between different frailty levels. Frequency domain measures such as spectral edge frequency were also higher for elderly fallers. Lastly, approximate entropy values were larger for subjects with Parkinson's disease and were significantly reduced after treatment. This information could help clinicians in their evaluations as well as in prescribing a physical fitness program to correct a specific deficit.},

Since the new curve is represented by an integral form of a unit quaternion curve, it is named a unit quaternion integral: QI curve. It is a generalization and an extension of the clothoid into the three dimensional space and the norm of its tangent is always equal to 1. Its curvature and variation of curvature are given by rather simple expressions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) successfully reduces pain, but has not achieved comparable improvements in function. We hypothesized that quadriceps strength affects performance by altering loading and movement patterns during functional tasks.
Methods: Fourteen subjects with isolated, unilateral TKA were tested three months after surgery. Quadriceps strength was assessed isometrically and kinematics, kinetics, and EMG were collected during level walking and sit-to-stand (STS). Function was assessed using the timed up and go test (TUG), stair climbing test (SCT), and the 6 min walk test (6MW).
Results: Functional performance was significantly related to the quadriceps strength of both legs, but was more strongly related to the uninvolved strength (involved rho = -0.43 with TUG; -0.65 with SCT; 0.64 with 6MW) (uninvolved rho = -0.63 with TUG; -0.68 with SCT; 0.77 with 6MW). During STS, subjects shifted weight away from the operated limb (p < 0.01). Quadriceps muscle activity and the extension moments at the knee and hip were smaller in the involved compared to the uninvolved (P < 0.05). The amount of asymmetry in knee excursion during weight acceptance in gait, the asymmetry in weight bearing from sit-to-stand, and the uninvolved hip extension moment during STS were related to the amount of asymmetry in quadriceps strength (rho > 0.56, p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Quadriceps weakness in patients with TKA has a substantial impact on the movement patterns and performance of the knee during functionally important tasks. (c) 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To investigate; (i) the relationship between the 5STS-test and lower extremity muscle strength and balance, and (ii) the variability of the 5STS-test in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Method: 22 MS patients were divided into two groups (Group A and Group B) who completed one 5STS familiarization test session and two testing sessions. In Group A, session 1 also included assessment of lower extremity muscle strength. Session 2 and 3 involved completion of two 5STS-tests and assessment of balance. In Group B, session 2 and 3 involved completion of two rounds of two 5STS-tests separated by a 30 min break. Results: Significant correlations were found between the 5STS-test and isometric and isokinetic knee flexor and extensor muscle strength of the most affected leg (R = -0.60 to -0.77), and between the 5STS-test and balance performance (R = 0.69). Intra-assessor day-to-day variability, intra-assessor test-retest variability and intra-assessor variability within test were 25.5, 22.3, and 23.1%, respectively. Inter-assessor variability within test and inter-assessor variability were 23.4 and 5.9%, respectively. Conclusions: The 5STS-test is related to lower extremity muscle strength and to balance performance in MS patients. For interventional purposes, a change of > 25% can be regarded as a real change.},

Objectives: To examine the (1) intrarater, interrater, and test-retest reliability of the 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (5-repetition STS test) scores, (2) correlation of 5-repetition STS test scores with lower-limb muscle strength and balance performance, and (3) cut-off scores among the 3 groups of subjects: the young, the healthy elderly, and subjects with stroke.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: University-based rehabilitation center.
Participants: A convenience sample of 36 subjects: 12 subjects with chronic stroke, 12 healthy elderly subjects, and 12 young subjects.
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures: 5-Repetition STS test time scores; hand-held dynamometer measurements of hip flexors, and knee flexors and extensors; ankle dorsiflexors and plantar-flexors muscle strength; Berg Balance Scale (BBS); and limits of stability (LOS) test using dynamic posturography.
Results: Excellent intrarater reliability of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (range, .970-.976), interrater reliability (ICC=.999), and test-retest reliability (ICC range, .989-.999) were found. Five-repetition STS test scores were also found to be significantly associated with the muscle strength of affected and unaffected knee flexors (p=-.753 to -.830; P<.00556) of the subjects with stroke. No significant associations were found between 5-repetition STS test and BBS and LOS tests in subjects with stroke. Cut-off scores of 12 seconds were found to be discriminatory between healthy elderly and subjects with stroke at a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 75%.
Conclusions: The 5-repetition STS test is a reliable measurement tool that correlates with knee flexors muscle strength but not balance ability in subjects with stroke.},

Design: A pre-test, post-test design was used.
Subjects: Six subjects at least one year post stroke and discharged from all rehabilitation services for at least six months participated in the study.
Outcome measures: Functional performance of sit-to-stand was evaluated using the Standing Up item of the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS). Peak vertical ground reaction force, walking speed over 10 m and grip strength were also measured.
Results: Group MAS score was significantly higher at post-test than at pretest with two subjects reaching the highest point on the scale and three subjects reaching the second highest point. Time-to-peak vertical ground reaction force occurred significantly closer to thighs-off, the critical time when the body mass is propelled into standing. Walking speed increased significantly over 10 m from a mean of 0.86 m/s to 1.10 m/s. Grip strength, which was not trained, did not change.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a home-based task-specific exercise and training protocol for STS can induce improved performance of STS and increase walking speed more than one year after stroke.},

In this study, we propose a nonlinear human bipedal model with thirteen generalized coordinates to model sit-to-stand (STS) transfer The model has three position based holonomic constraints and at the first stage, we decouple the translational variables (constrained system) from rotational variables (unconstrained systems). The unconstrained rotational degrees consist of seven sagittal and three frontal plane angles, which are controlled through their respective joint torques. We further decouple these angles in sagittal and frontal plane systems for a better control strategy. In this scheme, there are three decoupled controllers working together to stabilize the nonlinear model for a STS maneuver while satisfying the holonomic constraints. We adopt H-infinity and H-2 controller designs for feedback torques in sagittal and frontal planes, respectively, and provide simulation results to show the improvement in the angular profiles. We further adopt this modeling strategy to study and analyze the neuromuscular disorders by decoupling healthy and neurodeficient extremities. Our study indicates that the decoupling of the bipedal model improves the controllability of the system and produces better angular profiles for a bipedal STS maneuver This modeling scheme is useful for analysis of neuromuscular disorders and other relevant physiological motor control models.

   abstract = {Biomechanical movements have been subject of interest for several centuries to different researchers for various aspects. Physiologically human biomechanical sit to stand movement can be defined in different phases and regions. A four link biomechanical model of human stable movement is used to develop the local linear models for each phase from sitting on chair to an upright standing position. These local models are then integrated into a fuzzy model with Gaussian membership function. The knee flexion angle during sit to stand movement provides the criterion for determining the weights of fuzzy membership functions. H-2 dynamic optimal controller is designed for each local linear model and integrated with the fuzzy model. The joint's torque or inputs are computed by using linear fuzzy model based H-2 controller for linear and nonlinear biomechanical models. A reference trajectory is introduced to track the knee flexion angle error for smooth and physiological relevant sit to stand transfer. Simulation results of angular profiles and kinematics variables demonstrate the applicability of the fuzzy modeling with H-2 full order and reduced order controller for the biomechanical sit to stand movement.},

A bipedal model with full symmetry of limbs and movement is very redundant engineering design which has lots of unstable eigenvalues and poles. To avoid redundancy asymmetry is introduced which imposes coordination and controller design problem. In this paper, we are presenting a biomechanical bipedal model with 13 generalized coordinates of joint angles of right and left limbs in sagittal and frontal plane, a left foot translation. This model has no moment in right foot translation and asymmetrical reference trajectories in right and left limbs. An optimal controller design provides the feedback torque for stable sit-to-stand movement.

   abstract = {The neurophysiological mechanisms involved in postural stabilization are not well understood. Active and passive mechanisms at muscle and spinal levels as well as visual and vestibular processes are known to contribute toward postural stabilization and coordination of voluntary movement. The motivation for this research is to use a modeling-simulation framework to achieve two aims: (a) to ascertain viability of a physiologically motivated optimal controller design in the maintenance of posture and coordination of voluntary movement and (b) to study the relative contribution from active (feedforward) and passive (feedback) mechanisms in the execution of said movement. We employ a multi-segment sagittal model built on anatomical proportions with three degrees of freedom, including rotation at the ankle, knee, and hip joints. The behavior of the biomechanical model is controlled by an optimal linear quadratic regulator whose state and control weights are derived from physiological considerations. Representative postural and voluntary movements are simulated to illustrate the analysis-synthesis framework of biomechanical movement. Our analytical and simulation results support an active-passive model of postural stabilization and movement coordination. Besides expanding our understanding of the physiological stabilization processes in the body, the insight gained from this study promotes awareness of the existence of optimizing controllers in the central nervous system.},

We propose to use a fuzzy TSK biomechanical model to analyze, integrate, and study biomechanical STS movement. The fuzzy model combines two local linear models defined at the initiation and termination points of STS using Gaussian membership functions that operate on measurement of knee flexion. Further, we develop TSK fuzzy controllers that employ H-2 and H-infinity optimal control techniques for effective regulation of biomechanical STS. The fuzzy controllers similarly combine knowledge from local linear optimal controllers via membership functions. Our simulation results show that fuzzy TSK modeling is useful for the synthesis of STS movement because of its relevance with physiological principles and the use of localized control strategies for the joint torques.},

It examined the effect that sit to stand training has on balance and functional movement depending on the form of support surfaces. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty stroke patients were randomly sampled and divided into an unstable support surface group (15) and stable support surface group (15). In order to identify the effect depending on the form of support surfaces, 15 minutes of support surface training plus + 15 minutes of free gait training was performed. [Results] The results of the unstable support surface training showed that the corresponding sample t-test results were significant for the 7-item 3-point Berg balance scale, timed Up and Go test, and 6-minute walking test. The independent samples t-test, showed that there were significant outcomes in step length on the affected side, and step length on the unaffected side. [Conclusion] In conclusion, the sit to stand training on stable support surfaces was not as effective as the training using unstable support surfaces, but it is a simple and stable exercise with less risk of falls during training. It can also be performed alone by the patient in order to increase endurance and dynamic balance ability. Therefore, it is considered a useful exercise that can be performed alone by the patient outside the treatment room.},

Sagittal plane motion, ground reaction forces, and vertical chair arm rest forces were recorded during each trial with the signals synchronised at initial subject head movement. When rising from a high seat, subjects displayed significantly (p < 0.05) greater time to seat off; greater trunk, knee and ankle angles at seat off; increased ankle angular displacement; decreased knee angular displacement; and decreased total net and normalised arm rest forces compared to rising from a low seat. When rising using the ejector mechanism, time to seat off and trunk and knee angle at seat off significantly increased, whereas trunk and knee angular displacement, and total net and normalised arm rest forces significantly decreased compared to rising unassisted. Regardless of seat height or ejector mechanism use, there were no significant differences in the peak, or time to peak horizontal velocity of the subjects' total body centre of mass, or net knee and ankle moments. It was concluded that increased seat height and use of the ejector mechanism facilitated sit-to-stand transfers performed by elderly female rheumatoid arthritic patients. However, using the ejector chair may be preferred by these patients compared to merely raising seat height because it does not necessitate the use of a footstool, a possible obstacle contributing to falls.

The manipulator consists of a platform connected to ground by RPR chains. The set of positions and orientations available to the end-effector of a general RPR chain is mapped into the space of planar quaternions to obtain a quadratic manifold. The coefficients of this constraint manifold are functions of the locations of the base and platform R joints and the distance between them. Evaluating the constraint manifold at each desired pose and defining the limits on the extension of the P joint yields a set of equations. Solutions of these equations determine chains that contain the desired poses as part of their workspaces. Parallel manipulators that can reach the prescribed workspace are assembled from these chains. An example shows the determination of three RPR chains that form a manipulator able to reach a prescribed workspace.},

The proposed approach fuses data from inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and data from three-segment human body model using Extended Kalman filtering technique and in this way reduces inaccuracies associated with inertial sensors. Dynamic human body model is constructed based on principles of Lagrangian dynamics and incorporates shank, thigh and HAT (Head-Arms-Trunk) segments. The model equations, which are non-linear and coupled differential equations, are incorporated in the EKF to produce better kinematic parameter estimation of sit-to-stand motion. The moments needed in model equations (ankle, knee and hip moments) are calculated based on EKF last best estimate and Newton-Euler inverse dynamic approach. Outputs from EKF are segmental angles, angular rates of change and angular accelerations. These parameters fully describe the motion kinematics of human body. The performance of the method is verified by reference measurements acquired with optical motion measurement system Optotrak. Obtained results are presented and discussed. Conclusions are drawn and guidelines for future method,improvement are suggested.},

[Methods] In the STSE, subjects stood up and sat down without using their arms to push-off from the chair at standing up frequencies of 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 times per minutes. Subjects exercised for 5 minutes at each frequency with 5 minutes of rest between each consecutive frequency trial. The steady state of VO2 was evaluated by the difference in the VO2 between the 3rd and 5th min at each frequency. The correlation between the VO2 of the STSE and the standing up frequency was analyzed. [Results] At standing up frequencies greater than 24 times/min, the steady state of VO2 could not be confirmed. The relationship between the standing up frequency (at less than 24 times/min) and VO2 was strong (r=0.94).

   abstract = {Sit-to-stand exercise (STS) is a common activity of daily living. The objectives of the present study were: 1) to assess the validity of aerobic fitness measurements based on anaerobic thresholds (ATs), during incremental sit-to-stand exercise (ISTS) with and without arm support compared with an incremental cycle-ergometer (CE) test; and 2) to examine the reproducibility of the AT measured during the ISTSs. Twenty-six healthy individuals randomly performed the ISTS and CE test. Oxygen uptakes at the AT (AT-VO2) and heart rate at the AT (AT-HR) were determined during the ISTSs and CE test, and repeated-measures analyses of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test were used to evaluate the differences between these variables. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the strength of the relationship between AT-VO2 and AT-HR during the ISTSs and CE test. Data analysis yielded the following correlations: AT-VO2 during the ISTS with arm support and the CE test, r = 0.77 (p < 0.05); AT-VO2 during the ISTS without arm support and the CE test, r = 0.70 (p < 0.05); AT-HR during the ISTS with arm support and the CE test, r = 0.80 (p < 0.05); and AT-HR during the ISTS without arm support and the CE test, r = 0.66 (p < 0.05). The AT-VO2 values during the ISTS with arm support (18.5 +/- 1.9 mL.min(-1).kg(-1)) and the CE test (18.4 +/- 1.8 mL.min(-1).kg(-1)) were significantly higher than those during the ISTS without arm support (16.6 +/- 1.8 mL.min(-1).kg(-1); p < 0.05). The AT-HR values during the ISTS with arm support (126 +/- 10 bpm) and the CE test (126 +/- 13 bpm) were significantly higher than those during the ISTS without arm support (119 +/- 9 bpm; p < 0.05). The ISTS with arm support may provide a cardiopulmonary function load equivalent to the CE test; therefore, it is a potentially valid test for evaluating AT-VO2 and AT-HR in healthy, young adults.},

[Methods] All the participants were asked to perform sit-to-stand (STS) using three different strategies: (1) symmetric foot position, (2) unaffected foot placed behind the affected foot position (asymmetric-1), (3) affected foot placed behind the unaffected foot position (asymmetric-2). An EMG system was used to measure ES and GM muscle activities. The strategies were performed in a random order, and the mean values of five measurements were used in the analysis. One-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between the conditions. [Results] The affected ES muscle activity was significantly greater in asymmetric-2 (180.7 +/- 73.4) than in symmetrical foot placement (149.8 +/- 54.2). In addition, the affected ES, unaffected ES, and affected GM muscle activity were significantly greater in asymmetric-2 (180.7 +/- 73.4, 173.5 +/- 83.1, 98.3 +/- 90.3 respectively) than in asymmetric-1 foot placement (147.3 +/- 53.8, 151.2 +/- 76.5, 84.9 +/- 73.8 respectively). [Conclusion] Our results suggest that it may be more desirable for persons with stroke to place the affected foot behind the unaffected foot when performing STS to increase affected ES and GM muscle activation.},

   abstract = {Background: The need to predict decline in functional status in a large number of older adults has brought researchers and clinicians to develop easy-to-administer field tests. One of them is the 'multiple-sit-to-stand' (MSTS), which claims to measure leg strength. Objective: To assess the extent to which the MSTS is a leg strength, leg endurance or general endurance test. Methods: 49 independently functioning women (72.2 +/- 6.4 years) were assessed on the MSTS, on a submaximal stress test, and on strength and endurance of knee extensors measured by isokinetics. The knee extensors were selected, more than in other muscle groups responsible for movement of the lower extremity, as the largest range of motion, and the largest torques required while performing activities of daily living (ADL) is found in this group. Results: The correlation of the MSTS with the stress test was moderate and significant but very low and nonsignificant with the isokinetic measurements. Conclusions: The MTST is not able to predict strength of knee extensors, the leading group of leg muscles in ADL. If at all, it predicts general endurance rather than any measure - muscle strength or muscle endurance - of lower extremities. Longitudinal studies assessing the potential of the MSTS to predict deterioration in ADL in older adults are recommended, as well as studies assessing other factors related to both MSTS and ADL, such as muscle-nerve coordination affecting multiple joint activities.

   abstract = {Objective: To examine the contribution of balance ability, muscle strength, and exercise endurance to performance in the timed-sit-to-stand test among chronic hemiparetic subjects.
Design: A cross-sectional study with 68 community-dwelling stroke survivors.
Results: By using Pearson correlation coefficient, the five-times-sit-to-stand (FTSTS) test scores showed the highest negative correlation with Berg Balance Scale scores (r = -0.837, P < 0.001), and it showed significant moderate correlation with muscle strength index (r = -0.577, P < 0.001) and distance covered in a 6-min walk test (r = -0.598, P < 0.001). After controlling for demographic factors, significant partial correlation was identified between FTSTS scores and Berg Balance Scale scores only (r = -0.630, P < 0.001). Linear regression model, after accounting for demo-graphics and subjective balance confidence, showed that FTSTS scores were independently associated with Berg Balance Scale scores (beta = -0.630, P < 0.001), whereas muscle strength index and distance covered in the 6-min walk test were not significant predictors of FTSTS scores. The whole model could explain 71% of the variance in FTSTS scores.
Conclusions: This is the first study documenting the importance of balance ability, not muscle strength and exercise endurance, as an important determinant of performance on the FTSTS test by community-dwelling stroke patients. These findings suggest that the FTSTS test may be a more appropriate proxy indicator of balance performance in chronic community-dwelling stroke subjects.},

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of different arm positions and foot placements on the FTSTS completion times of older female adults. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-nine healthy female subjects, aged 63.1 +/- 5.3 years participated in this cross-sectional study. The times required to complete the FTSTS with 3 different arm positions (hands on thighs, arms crossed over chest, and an augmented arm position with the arms extended forward) and 2 foot placements (neutral and posterior) were recorded. The interaction effect and main effect of arm positions and foot placements were examined using a 3 (arm position) x 2 (foot placement) two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). [Results] There was no interaction effect among the 3 arm positions in the 2 foot placements. A significant main effect was identified for foot placement, but not arm position. Posterior foot placement led to a shorter FTSTS time compared to that of normal foot placement. [Conclusion] With the same arm position, FTSTS completion times with posterior foot placement tended to be shorter. Therefore, the standard foot placement should be used for FTSTS administration.},

In recent years, the application of robotic exoskeleton has become more prominent as to provide alternative solutions for physically less incapable people (PLIP) support in their daily movements. Most common difficulties faced by PLIP are in sit-to-stand, ascending and descending staircases. Unlike industrial robots, the robotic exoskeleton systems need to consider a special design because they directly interact with human user. In the mechanical design of these systems, human and robotic suitable kinematics, wearer safety, human user comfort wearing, low inertia, and adaptability should be especially considered. Controllability, responsiveness, flexible and smooth motion generation, and safety should especially be considered in the controllers of exoskeleton systems. Furthermore, the controller should generate the motions in accordance with the human motion intention. This paper briefly reviews the lower-limb robotic exoskeleton systems. In the short review, it is focused to identify the brief history, basic concept, challenges, and future development of the robotic exoskeleton systems to assist the physically less incapable people (PLIP) in rising up, sitting, ascending and descending staircases. Furthermore, key technologies of lower-limb exoskeleton systems are reviewed by taking state-of-the-art robot as examples.},

   abstract = {To better understand the complexities of rising from a seated to a standing position, a model of the human has been created. Sit-to-stand kinematics as well as ground reaction forces were measured experimentally and are used in an inverse dynamics analysis to estimate nine muscle forces during motion.
Calculated muscle forces are sensitive to assumptions made when modeling muscle paths. Changes in the line of action of a muscle due to interaction with anatomical constraints are often accounted for by including fixed via points in a model. Here an alternate approach of representing anatomical constraints using three-dimensional cylindrical geometries is derived and presented. In this mathematical model the course of the muscle is determined as the minimum-length path where the muscle is allowed to wrap freely over the surface of the cylinder.
Muscle forces are estimated for sit-to-stand by resolving net joint torques using an objective function giving preference to solutions minimizing both muscle stresses and abrupt changes in muscle forces. This is the first time muscle forces have been presented for sit-to-stand using a musculoskeletal model with included anatomical constraints represented using cylindrical wrapping geometries alone. A comparison of calculated muscle force patterns using fixed via points and wrapping points versus three-dimensional wrapping surfaces is made with reference to electromyographic phase data. For the sit-to-stand motion, the inclusion of anatomical constraints as three-dimensional cylindrical geometries results in calculation of muscle forces more true to the experimental data and more consistent with the belief that gradual motions are created by gradual changes in muscle force over time.},

Participants were 12 able-bodied older adults between the ages of 69 and 88 years. While each one performed the sit-to-stand transfer, a motion analysis system with 9 cameras recording at 60 Hz tracked the 3-D trajectories of retroreffective markers. Bilateral 3-D platform, grab rail, and seat force data were collected at 200 Hz and normalized to participant body weight. Four lateral conditions were tested: vertical, 45degrees inclined, and horizontal with the hand placed at 150 mm, and 400 mm forward of the seat front edge. Four anterior conditions were tested: vertical and horizontal orientations with the use of one hand and two hands. Posterior grab rail force increased with anterior assistance and with two-hand use compared to lateral assistance and single hand use, respectively. The selection of grab rail position and the number of hands incorporated during assistance also determined the symmetry of anteroposterior net joint forces, net joint moments, and joint powers. Grab rail orientation determined the height of the gripping hand which influenced the assistance strategy. Grab rail position, orientation, and the amount of upper body contribution influenced the assisted sit-to-stand transfer. These kinetic responses to grab rail location require careful consideration in order to optimize grab rail assistance during the sit-to-stand transfer.},

External reaction forces at the grab rail and floor interfaces were also investigated to understand the nature of the assistance provided by the introduction of unilateral upper body assistance. While 12 older aged adults performed the sit-to-stand, three-dimensional body segment kinematics were recorded to determine lower body joint motion and whole body centre of mass motion. Grab rail reaction forces and bilateral ground reaction forces were recorded to determine external reaction forces and lower body joint kinetics. Grab rail assisted conditions were compared with unassisted transfers. During grab rail assistance, a systematic asymmetry was introduced to lower limb joint kinetics, without noticeable alterations to peak lower body joint motion and whole body movement patterns. Ipsilateral net joint moments and powers decreased in the ankle and hip and increased in the knee, while the contralateral net joint moments and powers increased in the hip and decreased in the knee. Joint kinetic and kinematic responses suggest a motor control strategy that maintains symmetric sit-to-stand movement patterns by adjusting bilateral muscle control when a unilateral external reaction force is provided. Understanding the mechanical assistance that is generated during the sit-to-stand will facilitate optimal design of grab rails for older aged adults and may contribute to design for specific pathologies. Such design implementation will influence the ability of older aged adults to remain independent in the community. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods: We measured the electromyographic (EMG) data in the knee extensor on the affected side of 3 volunteers with post-stroke hemiparesis. We used a single-subject multiple-baseline research design across individuals. The EMG data were collected from knee extensors while performing the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks. The EMG activation and onset time ratios for the knee extensors were calculated by dividing the EMG activation and onset time of knee extensor action on the affected side by these on the unaffected side. MIT consisted of a 10-min detailed description of 5 stages: preparation, sit-to-stand tasks, weight shifting during standing, stand-to-sit tasks, and completion.
Results: During MIT, the EMG activation ratios of participants 1, 2, and 3 increased by 11.24%, 18.07%, and 26.91%, respectively, in the sit-to-stand task and by 12.11%, 14.31%, and 25.92%, respectively, in the stand-to-sit task. During MIT, the onset time of participants 1, 2, and 3 decreased by 36.09%, 24.27%, and 25.61%, respectively, in the sit-to-stand task and by 26.81%, 27.20%, and 22.83%, respectively, for the stand-to-sit task.

The model uses blood pressure as an input to predict baroreflex firing-rate, which in turn is used to predict efferent parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows. The model also includes the combined effects of vestibular and central command stimulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity, which is increased at the onset of postural change. Concentrations of acetylcholine and noradrenaline, predicted as functions of sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow, are then used to estimate the heart rate response. Dynamics of the heart rate and the baroreflex firing rate are modeled using a system of coupled ordinary delay differential equations with 17 parameters. We have derived sensitivity equations and ranked sensitivities of all parameters with respect to all state variables in our model. Using this model we show that during head-up tilt, the baseline firing- rate is larger than during sit-to-stand and that the combined effect of vestibular and central command stimulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity is less pronounced during head-up tilt than during sit-to-stand.},

   abstract = {Objective: To discuss the utility of Sit-to-Stand Test (STST) compared to the 6 min walking test (6MVY7) for the evaluation of functional status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Material-Method: Subjects: Fifty-three patients with stable COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) 46 +/- 9% predicted, mean age 71 +/- 12year) and 15 healthy individuals (mean FEV1D 101 +/- 13% predicted and mean age 63 +/- 8) were included.
Interventions: Functional performance was evaluated by STST and 6MW7. During the tests, severity of dyspnea (by Modified Borg Scale), heart rate, pulsed oxygen saturation (SPO2, by Modified Borg Scale) (by pulse oxymeter), blood pressure were measured. The pulmonary function (by spirometry), quadriceps femoris muscle strength (by manual muscle test) and quality of life (by Nottingham Health Profile Survey) were evaluated. Results: The STST and 6MWT results were lower in COPD group than the healthy group (P < 0.05). During the 6MWT the rise in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure and the decrease in SPO2 were statistically significant according to STST in COPD groups (P < 0.05). The STST and 6MWT were strongly correlated with each other in both groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, they were correlated with age, quality of life, peripheral muscle strength and dyspnea severity in COPD groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Similar to 6MW7, STST is also able to determine the functional state correctly. Additionally, it produces less hemodynamical stress compared to the 6MWT. In conclusion, STST can be used as an alternative of the 6MWT in patients with COPD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Sit-to-stand movement is an essential function for participation in many activities of daily living. Although this movement is one of the most important functional tasks, there is limited research investigating strategies of sit-to-stand movement in transtibial amputees.
Objectives: To examine movement strategies of the sit-to-stand task in persons with transtibial amputation and healthy non-amputated individuals.
Study design: Cross-sectional study.
Methods: A total of 12 male unilateral transtibial amputees and 19 healthy male subjects participated in this study. Sit-to-stand movement was evaluated in terms of weight transfer time, weight-bearing symmetry, sway velocity, and rising index by using Balance Master System.
Results: Participants in both groups exhibited similar weight-bearing transfer time (p > 0.05). Transtibial amputees demonstrated significantly greater weight-bearing asymmetry, higher sway velocity, and lower rising index than healthy subjects during the sit-to-stand transfer movement (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Transtibial amputees were unable to use the same movement strategies during a sit-to-stand task as healthy individuals; therefore, they had to develop new strategies to perform this task.},

Therefore, main events occur at the "same time" for all transformed curves and interesting features of individual recordings remain after averaging processes.
This paper presents an application of the registration process to the analysis of the vertical forces exerted on the ground by both feet during the sit-to-stand movement.

   abstract = {Despite repeated demonstration of how balance can be restored with protective stepping after the initiation of an induced fall, little is known about how accidental falling to the ground with the participant's body resting in a non-standing posture can be avoided during balance recovery. This is due to the difficulties inherent in experimentally eliciting such an event. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine failure rate and the characterization for balance recovery after young adults exposed to an experimentally induced novel slipping perturbation. Twenty-four healthy young adults first performed three to nine trials of regular sit-to-stand. In the following trial, slipping suddenly occurred during the termination of the sit-to-stand when the low-friction platform on which the participant stood was released. Participants were given no prior practice or knowledge of the experiment design. Slipping was then repeated in the subsequent trials. The results demonstrated for the first time that a high percentage (62%) of participants failed to recover standing balance, despite the fact that 14 of these 15 participants had initiated stepping at their first encounter of a sudden slip. Such failure was avoided immediately after the first encounter. It was postulated that a delay in the step initiation might have contributed to substantial vertical descent of the center-of-mass, leading to failure of balance recovery in limb collapse. To verify this and other hypotheses, a shift in experimental paradigms is warranted to include the study of spontaneous protective responses elicited when individuals first encounter previously unfamiliar balance perturbation as in real-life situations.

   abstract = {The speed at which sit-to-stand (STS) motions are performed and the subsequent terminal constraint on upright stance can present subjects with contradictory goals. Previous findings suggested that subjects might adopt a strategy of limiting the peak horizontal momentum of the center of mass (CM), and perhaps of body segments as well, regardless of the speed of ascent. The primary purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the limitation in CM momentum is related to the constraint on upright stance at the termination of die task. The secondary purpose was to describe the contribution of the shank, thigh, and upper body (head-arm-trunk) to die peak horizontal momentum of the CM under each test condition. Nine healthy adults rose from a seated position under the following three conditions: (a) at natural speeds (natural STS); (b) as fast as possible (fast STS); and (c) as fast as possible, followed by falling forward while keeping the feet fixed and using the arms on a support bar to stop the fall (fast STS+fall). The results showed that the peak horizontal momentum of the CM did not change substantially from the natural to fast STS, but increased significantly from the fast STS to the fast STS+fall. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that limiting peak horizontal momentum of the CM may reflect a movement control strategy related to maintaining equilibrium at the termination of the voluntary task of rising from a chair. The momentum profile of the upper body, but not of the thigh or shank, remained constant across all experimental conditions, suggesting that the motion of the upper body may be tightly controlled in STS, regardless of the altered constraint on balance.},

However, the peak hip extension and ankle plantar flexion RJTs remained relatively constant across the range of the speeds.

The present study investigated the segmental origin of this directionally specific difference by examining the linear momentum of the shank, thigh, and head-arm-trunk segments for ten healthy young adults at slow, natural, and fast self-selected speeds.  Findings indicated that the head-arm-trunk was the major contributor to the horizontal maximum linear momentum of the CM and accounted for the relative invariance in its magnitude.  In contrast, the thigh was the major contributor to the vertical maximum linear momentum of the CM and was responsible for the progressive increase in its magnitude across the range of speeds.  Moreover, the compatibility between the motions of the head-arm-trunk and of the shank in their general profile and peak magnitudes further suggested that a simplifying strategy may have been employed to reduce the overall number of degrees of freedom associated with the sit-to-stand movement.},

   abstract = {For field applicability of biomechanical methodologies aiming at assessing motor ability in disabled, or at risk of disablement (e.g, elderly), subjects, measurements must be carried out using a least perceivable to the subject and essential experimental apparatus. Since data thus obtained do not necessarily lend themselves to straightforward interpretation, they should be fed to a model of the portion of the musculo-skeletal system involved that already embodies the invariant aspects of both the modelled system and the motor task. Through such a minimum measured-input model, richer, physiology-related, and thus easier to interpret, information may be expected. In this Framework, the present study investigated the sit-to-stand motor task using information obtained only from a force plate located under seal and subject's feet, a seat uniaxial load-cell and basic anthropometric parameters. Data were collected in a sample of 12 able-bodied subjects while executing the motor task at different speeds. The musculo-skeletal system was modelled as a telescopic inverted pendulum (TIP) that could vary its length (shortening or elongation) by effect of a force actuator and its orientation in space by effect of two couple actuators that were looked upon as muscle equivalent effectors. The TIP model output consisted in the kinematics and dynamics of these actuators. It allowed the identification of four functional phases in which the seat-to-stand motor task could be divided, and a detailed description of the relevant mechanics in terms of balance control and centre of mass elevation. Motor strategy modifications associated with speed variation could also be identified. For a global evaluation of the motor act it showed to be no less informative than more demanding multi-segment models. Although it is true that specific musculo-articular functions can only be inferred, the more compact information yielded by the TIP model is expected to Facilitate subject and or disability classification.

   abstract = {For the execution of a certain motor task, a motor strategy is chosen by each individual among those that are consistent with the structural and functional constraints of his/her locomotor system, and that tends to maximise the effectiveness of the motor act. The identification of this strategy allows for the assessment of the individual's functional status. This study aimed at identifying the motor strategies adopted for the execution of the sit-to-stand motor task, at different speeds and initial postures, in a sample of 35 community-dwelling elders and in a sample of 16 young able-bodied individuals. This was done using a method, least perceivable to the test subject and "economical" for the experimenter, which entailed the recording of external forces only. A musculo-skeletal system model, based on a telescopic inverted-pendulum (TIP) moved by a linear and two rotational muscle-equivalent actuators, was then used. Parameters describing the kinematics and dynamics of these actuators were extracted and submitted to statistical analysis. Different motor strategies were identified in the two age groups, as well as associated with both a different initial posture (ankle dorsiflexion angle) and speed of execution of the motor task. In particular, the elder group, as compared with the young group, prior to seat-off tended to flex the trunk more, thus bringing the CM closer to the base of support, and at a higher velocity, thus gaining a higher momentum. After seat-off, elders rotated the body forward and, only after having brought their CM over the base of support, effectively started elevation. Both global muscular effort and coordination effort associated with the achievement of balance and raising were lower. However, maximal speed was also lower. The above results indicated that the elders could count on a lower functional reserve than the young individuals and, from the methodological viewpoint, that the TIP approach is a good candidate for subject-specific functional evaluation in a clinical context.

Unlike our previous works and the majority of the published studies, where UPDRS tasks were the sole focus, in this paper, we carry out a comparative investigation of the LA, S2S, and G tasks. In particular, after providing an accurate description of the features identified for the kinematic characterization of the three tasks, we comment on the correlation between the most relevant kinematic parameters and the UPDRS scoring. We analyzed the performance achieved by the automatic UPDRS scoring system and compared the estimated UPDRS evaluation with the one performed by neurologists, showing that the proposed system compares favorably with typical interrater variability. We then investigated the correlations between the UPDRS scores assigned to the various tasks by both the neurologists and the automatic system. The results, based on a limited number of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) (34 patients, 47 clinical trials), show poor-to-moderate correlations between the UPDRS scores of different tasks, highlighting that the patients' motor performance may vary significantly from one task to another, since different tasks relate to different aspects of the disease. An aggregate UPDRS score is also considered as a concise parameter, which can provide additional information on the overall level of the motor impairments of a Parkinson's patient. Finally, we discuss a possible implementation of a practical e-health application for the remote monitoring of PD patients.},

Design: Case-control study.
Setting: Inpatients in a university-affiliated hospital.
Subjects: Forty spastic diplegic children aged from 2 to 6 years (18 children with botulinum toxin type A injection into both gastrocnemius muscles as an experimental group and 14 children without injection as a control group).
Main measures: Sit-to-stand transfer task was evaluated using a motion analyser (Vicon 370 MA with six infrared cameras). The tests were performed twice with a two- week interval. The changes in temporal, kinematic and kinetic parameters were investigated in each group.
Results: In the control group there were no significant changes in any of the measured parameters between the tests. In the experimental group, total duration (s) of sit-to-stand transfer was shortened after injection (4.35+/-2.49 to 2.89+/-1.48, P < 0.05). The maximal angles (degrees) of pelvic and hip joints were reduced (28.88+/-5.53 to 26.57+/-3.73 and 90.78+/-8.69 to 87.23+/-8.76) and the initial angle of ankle dorsiflexion was increased (4.41+/-6.16 to 7.08+/-6.09) after injection (P < 0.05). The maximal moments (Nm/kg) of the hip and knee joints (0.44+/-0.17 to 0.51+/-0.21 and 0.13+/-0.05 to 0.18+/-0.14) were increased while that of the ankle joint was reduced (0.32+/-0.09 to 0.28+/-0.10) after injection (P < 0.05). Only the cases with greater reduction of spasticity showed an improvement on kinematic and kinetic parameters.
Conclusion: Botulinum toxin type A injection into spastic ankle plantarflexors led to better accomplishment of sit-to-stand transfer in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.},

Design: Before-after trial.
Setting: University-affiliated hospital.
Participants: Nineteen spastic diplegic children (age range, 2-6y).
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures: The transitional movement of STS was tested in random order with children while wearing the barefoot and hinged AFOs. The temporal, kinematic, and kinetic data during the task were collected by using a motion analyzer (with 6 infrared cameras). Statistical comparison between barefoot and hinged AFO was done with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results: Total duration of STS transfer was significantly shortened with the hinged AFO (P<.05). The initial knee flexion, the initial angle, and the final angle of ankle dorsiflexion were increased with the AFO, compared with when barefoot (P<.05). However, the increased pelvic tilt and hip flexion while barefoot was not reduced with the AFO. The maximal moment and power of hip and knee joints were significantly increased with the AFO (P<.05), whereas the maximal moment and power of the ankle joint were not significantly changed when wearing the AFO.
Conclusions: Although proximal compensatory strategy of increased pelvic tilt and hip flexion did not change with the hinged AFO, some improvements of temporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters were identified during the task. These findings suggest that a hinged AFO is beneficial for STS transfer activity for children with spastic diplegia.},

Using Lie theory, we show that no bi-invariant distance metric (i.e., one that is invariant under both left and right translations) exists in SE(3), and that because physical space does not have a natural length scale, any distance metric in SE(3) will ultimately depend on a choice of length scale. We show how to construct left- and right-invariant distance metrics in SE(3), and suggest a particular left-in-variant distance metric parametrized by length scale that is useful for kinematic applications. Ways of including engineering considerations into the choice of length scale are suggested, and applications of this distance metric to the design and positioning of certain planar and spherical mechanisms are given.},

The objective function is defined in terms of a class of distance metrics on the rigid body motions that are invariant with respect to choice of fixed reference frame. A main contribution of this article is an explicit expression for the gradient of this objective function with respect to the kinematic parameters. With this analytic gradient, efficient optimization algorithms can now be developed for the design of general spatial mechanisms.

   abstract = {In this article we generalize the concept of Bezier curves to curved spaces, and illustrate this generalization with an application in kinematics. We show how De Casteljau's algorithm for constructing Bezier curves can be extended in a natural way to Riemannian manifolds. We then consider a special class of Riemannian manifold, the Lie groups. Because of their group structure Lie groups admit an elegant, efficient recursive algorithm for constructing Bezier curves. Spatial displacements of a rigid body also form a Lie group, and can therefore be interpolated (in the Bezier sense) using this recursive algorithm. We apply this algorithm to the kinematic problem of trajectory generation or motion interpolation for a moving rigid body. The orientation trajectory of motions generated in this way have the important property of being invariant with respect to choices of inertial and bodyfixed reference frames.},

By drawing upon the large body available results for the optimal control of linear systems with quadratic criteria, our approach provides a flexible method for designing developable surfaces that are optimized for various criteria.},

   abstract = {Sit-to-stand (STS) is a functional dynamic task, requiring movement of the lumbar spine, however, little is known about whether regional differences or between-gender differences exist during this task. The aim of this study was to confirm whether kinematic differences existed within regions of the lumbar spine during STS and also to determine whether between-gender differences were evident. An electromagnetic measurement device, recording at 25 Hz, determined how different lumbar spine regions (combined, lower and upper) moved during STS in 29 healthy participants (16 males, 13 females). Discrete outputs including mean range of motion (ROM), maximum and minimum were calculated for each lumbar spine region. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with repeated measures were used to determine whether regional differences and between-gender differences were evident in the lumbar spine during STS. With the lumbar spine modelled as two segments, the lower lumbar (LLx) and upper lumbar (ULx) regions made different contributions to STS: F-1,F- (27) = 21.8; p < 0.001. No between-gender differences were found with the lumbar spine modelled as a single region (combined lumbar: CLx), however, modelled as two regions there was a significant gender difference between the LLx and ULx regions: F-1,F- 27 = 7.3 (p = 0.012). The results indicate that modelling the lumbar spine as a single segment during STS does not adequately represent lumbar spine kinematics and there are important gender differences. These findings also need to be considered when investigating STS in clinical populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Twelve women with unilateral knee OA (age 60.33 +/- 6.66 years, height 1.61 +/- 0.05 m, mass 77.08 +/- 9.2 kg) and 11 controls (age 56.54 +/- 5.46 years, height 1.64 +/- 0.05 m, mass 77.36 +/- 13.34 kg) participated in this study. Subjects performed a sit-to-stand movement from a chair while position of center of pressure and knee angular speed were recorded. Furthermore, maximal isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength at 60 degrees/s, 120 degrees/s and 150 degrees/s was measured. Surface, electromyography (EMG) from the biceps femoris (BF), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) was recorded during all tests. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that during the sit-to-stand OA group demonstrated significantly lower knee angular speed (44.49 +/- 9.61 degrees/s vs. 71.68 +/- 19.86 degrees/s), a more posterior position of the center of pressure (39.20 +/- 7.02% vs. 41.95 +/- 2.49%) and a higher antagonist BF activation (57.13 +/- 20.55% vs. 32.01 +/- 19.5%) compared with controls (p < 0.05). Further, women with knee OA demonstrated a lower Moment-to-EMG ratio than controls in extension and eccentric flexion at 60 degrees/s and 150 degrees/s, while the opposite was found for concentric flexion at 60 degrees/s (p < 0.05). Among other factors, the slower performance of the sit-to-stand movement in women with OA is due to a less efficient use of the knee extensor muscles (less force per unit of EMG) and, perhaps, a higher BF antagonist co-activation. This may lead subjects with OA to adopt a different movement strategy compared with controls. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Method: The center of pressure (CoP) behavior of 23 TD children and 6 children with spastic hemiplegic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] I and II) was assessed during STS movement performance and during static standing conditions with the use of a force plate. The data obtained from the force plate were used to calculate CoP variables: anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) amplitudes of CoP displacement and the area and velocity of CoP oscillation. Results: According to the Mann-Whitney test, children with CP exhibited higher CoP values in all of the analyzed variables during the beginning of STS movement. Pearson's correlation verified a positive correlation between the CoP variables during both static conditions and the performance of STS movement. Conclusions: Children with spastic hemiplegic CP present major postural oscillations during the beginning of STS movement compared with typical children. Moreover, the observed relationship between postural control in static and dynamic conditions reveals the importance of body control in the static position for the performance of functional activities that put the body in motion, such as STS movement.},

   abstract = {While neuromotor responses associated with successfully restoring balance have been widely characterized, little is known of how responses employed to regain balance fail. We identified biomechanical factors that characterized the unsuccessful recovery responses to a novel perturbation. An unexpected forward slip was induced, using a low-friction platform, just after seat-off of a sit-to-stand in 41 young subjects. Kinematic variables describing the recovery responses were compared between fallers and those who recovered; "falls" into the fall-arrest system were identified based on center of mass (COM) descent. Twelve "single-step" falls, four "multi-step" falls, and 11 recoveries resulted. Single-step fallers exhibited a more posterior COM at slip onset, support (nonstepping) limb collapse resulting in hip vertical descent, and a shortened protective step backward. A factor analysis indicated that six common factors explained 88% of the variance in 22 kinematic variables describing the slip and recovery response. Single-step falls were associated with two factors, one related to initial or imposed instability and one to the reactive response. The former factor indicated that step length and COM position at step touchdown were related to COM position at slip onset. Support limb collapse comprised the latter factor. Multi-step fallers, by appearance, exhibited a shortened initial backward step that was ineffective at enabling balance recovery. As a whole, the results indicated that unsuccessful recovery was associated with a diminished stepping response. Fallers may have inadequately scaled an appropriate reflexive stepping response or might, inappropriately, have reflexively attempted to recover without stepping. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Background. In older patients, hospitalization is associated with a decline in functional performance and loss of muscle strength. Loss of muscle strength and functional performance can be prevented by systematic strength training, but details are lacking regarding the optimal exercise program and dose for older patients. Therefore, our aim was to test the feasibility of a progression model for loaded sit-to-stand training among older hospitalized patients.
Methods. This is a prospective cohort study conducted as a feasibility study prior to a full-scale trial. We included twenty-four older patients (>= 65 yrs) acutely admitted from their own home to the medical services of the hospital. We developed an 8-level progression model for loaded sit-to-stands, which we named STAND. We used STAND as a model to describe how to perform the sit-to-stand exercise as a strength training exercise aimed at reaching a relative load of 8-12 repetitions maximum (RM) for 8-12 repetitions. Weight could be added by the use of a weight vest when needed. The ability of the patients to reach the intended relative load (8-12 RM), while performing sit-to-stands following the STAND model, was tested once during hospitalization and once following discharge in their own homes. A structured interview including assessment of possible modifiers (cognitive status by the Short Orientation Memory test and mobility by the De Morton Mobility Index) was administered both on admission to the hospital and in the home setting. The STAND model was considered feasible if: (1) 75% of the assessed patients could perform the exercise at a given level of the model reaching 8-12 repetitions at a relative load of 8-12 RM for one set of exercise in the hospital and two sets of exercise at home; (2) no ceiling or floor effect was seen; (3) no indication of adverse events were observed. The outcomes assessed were: level of STAND attained, the number of sets performed, perceived exertion (the Borg scale), and pain (the Verbal Ranking Scale).
Results. Twenty-four patients consented to participate. Twenty-three of the patients were tested in the hospital and 19 patients were also tested in their home. All three criteria for feasibility were met: (1) in the hospital, 83% could perform the exercise at a given level of STAND, reaching 8-12 repetitions at 8-12 RM for one set, and 79% could do so for two sets in the home setting; (2) for all assessed patients, a possibility of progression or regression was possible-no ceiling or floor effect was observed; (3) no indication of adverse events (pain) was observed. Also, those that scored higher on the De Morton Mobility Index performed the exercise at higher levels of STAND, whereas performance was independent of cognitive status.
Conclusions. We found a simple progression model for loaded sit-to-stands (STAND) feasible in acutely admitted older medical patients (>= 65 yrs), based on our pre-specified criteria for feasibility.},

Twenty-three children with SD aged 5 to 12 years were recruited. Individualized PSE was composed by a music therapist based on each subject's sit-to-stand (STS) movement with 50% 1-repetition maximum load. Each subject performed LSTS continuously for eight repetitions under randomly assigned music or no-music (Control) conditions while the kinematic and kinetic data were measured simultaneously. For the music condition, PSE music was played only during the first five repetitions (PSE condition), and the following three repetitions were referred to as the Continuation condition. Paired t- or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare the variables between the PSE and Control conditions, and between the Continuation and Control conditions. Compared to the Control condition, greater peak knee extensor power (P = 0.009), greater total extensor power (P = 0.015), and better center-of-mass smoothness (P = 0.01), but less movement time (P = 0.003) were found in the PSE condition. Significant effects of the PSE music on the above variables were also found for Continuation condition. The current results showed that individualized PSE music helped improve the performance of LSTS in children with SD. The associated biomechanical features also continued to exist in subsequent movement cycles after the music had ceased. These findings suggest that therapy using LSTS combined with PSE music may be beneficial for rehabilitating children with SD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A second purpose was to evaluate whether self-reported functioning matches evaluated performance of the activities. Subjects (N = 100; age 73 +/- 0.9 years) participated in isometric knee extension strength tests, performed three functional ambulatory tasks (chair rise. gait speed. and stair ascent and descent), and answered standard survey questions assessing physical function. Significant relationships were observed between functional performance and the ratio of isometric leg extension peak torque to body weight (STR/WT) for each activity (p < .0001). For each activity, thresholds of STR/WT between 3.0 and 3.5 N m/kg were observed. below which the likelihood for success was reduced. Thresholds were determined by calculating the value of STR/WT that minimized the classification error. Individuals with a STR/WT < 3.0 N m/kg are at a substantial risk for impaired function in chair rise. gait speed, and stair ascent and descent. Sensitivity and specificity of STR/WT as a predictor of functional success ranged from 76% to 81% and from 78% to 94%. respectively, depending on activity. This is of clinical significance, as the STR/WT thresholds can identify individuals with preclinical disability (beginning to have difficulty with ambulatory tasks) as Opposed to those in whom an outright disability is observed. This may be useful for targeting individuals for strengthening interventions and developing specific intervention goals.},

   journal = {Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews},

   note = {Ai2ad
Times Cited:1
Cited References Count:82},
   abstract = {Background
Standing up from a seated position is one of the most frequently performed functional tasks, is an essential pre-requisite to walking and is important for independent living and preventing falls. Following stroke, patients can experience a number of problems relating to the ability to sit-to-stand independently.
Objectives
To review the evidence of effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving sit-to-stand ability after stroke. The primary objectives were to determine (1) the effect of interventions that alter the starting posture (including chair height, foot position, hand rests) on ability to sit-to-stand independently; and (2) the effect of rehabilitation interventions (such as repetitive practice and exercise programmes) on ability to sit-to-stand independently. The secondary objectives were to determine the effects of interventions aimed at improving ability to sit-to-stand on: (1) time taken to sit-to-stand; (2) symmetry of weight distribution during sit-to-stand; (3) peak vertical ground reaction forces during sit-to-stand; (4) lateral movement of centre of pressure during sit-to-stand; and (5) incidence of falls.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2013), EMBASE (1980 to June 2013), CINAHL (1982 to June 2013), AMED (1985 to June 2013) and six additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers and contacted experts.
Selection criteria
Randomised trials in adults after stroke where: the intervention aimed to affect the ability to sit-to-stand by altering the posture of the patient, or the design of the chair; stated that the aim of the intervention was to improve the ability to sit-to-stand; or the intervention involved exercises that included repeated practice of the movement of sit-to-stand (task-specific practice of rising to stand).
The primary outcome of interest was the ability to sit-to-stand independently. Secondary outcomes included time taken to sit-to-stand, measures of lateral symmetry during sit-to-stand, incidence of falls and general functional ability scores.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors and method of dealing with missing data.
Main results
Thirteen studies (603 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review, and data from 11 of these studies were included within meta-analyses. Twelve of the 13 included studies investigated rehabilitation interventions; one (nine participants) investigated the effect of altered starting posture for sit-to-stand. We judged only four studies to be at low risk of bias for all methodological parameters assessed. The majority of randomised controlled trials included participants who were already able to sit-to-stand or walk independently.
Only one study (48 participants), which we judged to be at high risk of bias, reported our primary outcome of interest, ability to sit-to-stand independently, and found that training increased the odds of achieving independent sit-to-stand compared with control (odds ratio (OR) 4.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 16.50, very low quality evidence).
Interventions or training for sit-to-stand improved the time taken to sit-to-stand and the lateral symmetry (weight distribution between the legs) during sit-to-stand (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.06, seven studies, 335 participants; and SMD 0.85; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.33, five studies, 105 participants respectively, both moderate quality evidence). These improvements are maintained at long-term follow-up.
Few trials assessing the effect of sit-to-stand training on peak vertical ground reaction force (one study, 54 participants) and functional ability (two studies, 196 participants) were identified, providing very low and low quality evidence respectively.
The effect of sit-to-stand training on number of falls was imprecise, demonstrating no benefit or harm (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, five studies, 319 participants, low quality evidence). We judged the majority of studies that assessed falls to be at high risk of bias.
Authors' conclusions This review has found insufficient evidence relating to our primary outcome of ability to sit-to-stand independently to reach any generalisable conclusions. This review has found moderate quality evidence that interventions to improve sit-to-stand may have a beneficial effect on time taken to sit-to-stand and lateral symmetry during sit-to-stand, in the population of people with stroke who were already able to sit-to-stand independently. There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions relating to the effect of interventions to improve sit-to-stand on peak vertical ground reaction force, functional ability and falls. This review adds to a growing body of evidence that repetitive task-specific training is beneficial for outcomes in people receiving rehabilitation following stroke.},

A multiple-shooting optimization estimates the parameters of a rigid-body simulation needed to simulate an animation that matches the sketch with physically plausible timing and motion. This technique applies to physical simulations of multiple colliding rigid bodies possibly connected with joints in a tree (open-loop) topology.},

In particular, we study the approximation of data lines by, in a certain sense, 'linear' families of lines. These sets are, for instance linear complexes and linear congruences. An application is the reconstruction of helical surfaces or surfaces of revolution from scattered data points. This is based on the fact that the normals of these surfaces lie in linear complexes; in particular, normals of surfaces of revolution intersect the axis of revolution.Approximation with linear complexes or congruences is also useful in detecting singular positions of serial or parallel robots. These are positions where the rebut should be a rigid system but possesses an undesirable and unexpected instantaneous self motion. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to compare electromyographic activities between and within the paretic and nonparetic lower limb muscles during the sit-to-stand (STS) task in subjects with hemiparesis as a result of stroke.
Design: This is a cross-sectional study.
Results: All monitored muscles of both lower limbs remained active during most of the sit-to-stand task; the muscles were activated before the seat-off and reached the maximum peak of electromyographic activity after the seat-off (P < 0.01). As compared with the paretic limb, the nonparetic limb exhibited earlier activation of the hamstrings (P < 0.01); longer activation period (P < 0.01); and higher electromyographic activity of the tibialis anterior, the soleus, and the quadriceps (P <= 0.02). The activity onset time was similar in all muscles of the nonparetic lower limb (P >= 0.053), whereas the tibialis anterior of the paretic lower limb was activated before the hamstring and the soleus (P <= 0.015). These results illustrate that muscle activation of both limbs during the sit-to-stand task was impaired but in a higher level in the paretic side.
Conclusions: Neuromuscular coordination abnormalities were observed in both lower limbs. The paretic limb was unable to recruit the muscles at the proper time and to achieve the amplitude for executing the sit-to-stand task, whereas significant compensations occurred on the nonparetic side.},

This is a continuation of the first work reported on 4MDS, which provides an interactive, graphical, and geometric constraint based mechanism design system for the exact- and approximate-motion synthesis problems. Theoretical foundation of the 4MDS is laid over a kinematic mapping based unified formulation of the geometric constraints (circle, fixed-line, line-tangent-to-a-circle) associated with the mechanical dyads (RR, PR, and RP) of a planar four-bar mechanism. An efficient algorithm extracts the geometric constraints of a given motion task and determines the best dyad types as well as their dimensions that best fit to the motion. Often, Mechanism designers need to impose additional geometric constraints, such as specification of location of fixed pivots or ground-link line. If synthesized mechanism suffers from branch, circuit, or order defect, they may also desire rectified solutions by allowing a tolerance to certain or all task positions. Such functions are crucial to a practitioner and much needed during the conceptual design stage of machine design process.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we are presenting a framework for capturing human motions using Microsoft Kinect sensor for the purpose of 1) generating task positions for mechanism and robot synthesis, and 2) generation and visualization of B-spline inter-polated and approximated motion from the captured task positions. The theoretical foundation of this work lies in Kinematic Mapping, Dual and Bi-quaternions, and NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-spline) geometry. Lately, Kinect has opened doors for creation of natural and intuitive human-machine interactive (HMI) systems in medicine, robotic manipulation, CAD, and many other fields, where visual-sensing and -capture is a central theme. Kinect has made a huge impact in physical therapy area, achieving new benchmarks in tele-rehabilitation by improving physical exercise assessment, monitoring and supervision using the skeletal data. Moreover, Kinect’s depth sensing capability has helped in retrieving depth information required for robotic vision in grasping, object recognition which was previously done using computationally demanding computer vision algorithms. Kinect’s point cloud data with interactive gestures has proven to be useful in various CAD software for conceptual design of shapes. Mechanism synthesis is one of the areas in Kinematics, where Kinect-provided skeletal data can be leveraged to design and develop highly customized end-user collaborated mechanism solutions. We demonstrate that using Kinect, OpenGL, and Openframeworks, we can capture discrete (or, key) rigid body displacements, continuous motions, and generate and visualize rational B-spline motions from captured key positions. Capturing only a few key positions results in significant data savings and also provides a natural way to create tasks for mechanism synthesis problems. The output is a set of dual quaternions and 4 × 4 homogeneous transforms representing a task motion, which can be used as an input for mechanism synthesis applications. The tool produced also allows users to generate trajectories of various points on a moving rigid body interactively. A Kinect-based capture of such motions can help create highly-customized assistive devices for people who suffer from a range of motion-related difficulties due to old age or disabilities.},

The unified algorithm also admits additional practical constraints, such as imposition of fixed- and moving-pivot and -line locations along with mixed exact- and approximate-synthesis scenarios. In that regard, its synthesis capabilities set it apart from other softwares of its ilk. However, its simulation approach also departs from more traditional methods, which typically involves assembling four rigid bodies and then designating fixed and moving links. Instead, the MotionGen requires users to assemble only two of the geometric constraints of mechanical dyads for quick prototyping of planar four-bar linkages. The app is equipped with an intuitive graphical user interface that allows a fluid dialog with the user to facilitate rapid manipulation and visualization of linkages.},

The goal is to obtain a simple, efficient and explicit method for determining the PD of spatial displacements in Euclidean three-space that belong to a special Euclidean Group known as SE(3). It has been known that such a decomposition is equivalent to the projection of an element of SE(3) onto SO(4) that yields hyper spherical displacements that best approximate rigid-body displacements. It is shown in this paper that a dual quaternion representing an element of SE(3) can be decomposed into a pair of unit quaternions, called double quaternion, that represents an element of SO(4). Furthermore, this decomposition process may be interpreted as the projection of a point in four-dimensional space onto a unit hypersphere. An example is provided to illustrate that the results obtained from this dual-quaternion based polar decomposition are same as those obtained from the matrix based polar decomposition.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose
During the aging process, older adults may experience a loss of strength and power, which then may lead to functional limitations and disability. The purpose of this study was to examine how impairments in lower-extremity strength and power are related to functional limitations and disability in community-dwelling older adults.
Subjects
Thirty older adults (age [(X) over bar +/- SD], 77.3 +/- 7.0 years; 25 women and 5 men) with mild to moderate functional limitations participated in this study.
Methods
Lower-extremity strength, peak power, power at a low relative intensity, and power at a high relative intensity were measured with a pneumatic resistance leg press. Functional limitations and disability were assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT), and the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI).
Results
All measures of strength and power were related to functional limitations. Peak power demonstrated the strongest relationships with SMWT, the SPPB gait speed subscale, and the LLFDI functional limitation component. Power at a high relative intensity demonstrated the strongest relationships to the SPPB total score and the SPPB sit-to-stand subscale score. All measures of strength and power were indirectly related to the LLFDI disability component.
Discussion and Conclusion
Older adults should focus on increasing and maintaining lower-extremity strength and power across a range of intensities in order to decrease functional limitations and disability.},

We examined whether this effect also occurs in complex movements such as the sit-to-stand manoeuvre (STS). Nine healthy volunteers performed STS to visual IS, either presented alone (control trials) or together with SAS (test trials). Reaction time, measured as the time between IS and take-off (TO), was significantly shortened in test trials when SAS was applied at an interval of 0 ms with respect to IS. The onset latency of EMG bursts recorded from tibialis anterior, lumbar paraspinal, quadriceps and biceps femoris muscles reduced proportionally to the shortening of TO. However, these effects were not observed if SAS was delivered 150 ms after IS, when the manoeuvre had already started. Our results suggest that stimuli acting on subcortical motor structures speed-up but do not otherwise interfere with the execution of the motor programs underlying the STS manoeuvre.},

An object (arm of a robot...) is moved with respect to a fixed system. Methods from freeform curve design provide powerful tools to handle such problems. Some of these methods and results shall be presented in this survey. Here one can find a (geometric) approach including solutions of interpolation problems. First attempts an studied. Then we state two principal demands on the result of such a design process: The motions should be rational and invariant with respect to changes of coordinates in fixed and moving frame, respectively. We use quaternions to describe displacements and motions and give an overview on rational spline motions. Some known results on interpolating motions are reviewed. Then a third demand is presented: The design process should be 'repeatable' in the following sense: If a solution is computed the algorithm should give the same solution (including parametrisation), if we start with new input data generated by our first solution. The paper includes suggestions for further research. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: We aimed to assess the measurement properties and the minimal important difference (MD) of the 1-min sit-to-stand (STS) test in cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Patients with CF were tested during a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Five STS tests were performed during the program; two tests at the beginning (STS0 and STS1) and three tests at the end (STS2a-2c). Exercise capacity, pulmonary function, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-reported health status were measured at the beginning and end of the program. We calculated overall mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the STS test. The MID was calculated using anchor-based and distributional methods. Results: Fourteen participants (8 female, mean age 30.4 +/- 6.1 years) were included. STS test performance increased significantly from STS0 to STS1 indicative of a learning effect. Test-retest reliability for the subsequent STS2a-2c tests was excellent (ICC 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99). The estimated MID for the STS test was 5 repetitions. STS test performance was responsive to change (effect size of 0.97) and correlated with exercise capacity (r = 0.63-0.73) and with the physical functioning HRQoL scale (r = 0.72). Conclusions: The 1-min STS test appears to be a reliable, valid, and feasible test to measure functional capacity in patients with CF. (C) 2015 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

This study presents a dynamic simulation of humanoid model performing sit-to-stand (SiSt) exercise. The main goals of this project are; the development of humanoid model with seesaw exercise machine, and the development of controller for controlled movement of the system. To achieve this, a humanoid model with seesaw mechanism have been designed in Visual Nastran software, while a closed loop system with PD, (proportional-plus-derivative) controllers that track desired reference input have been implemented by Matlab/Simulink. Here, both software packages (Visual Nastran and Matlab/Simulink) have been integrated in order to produce the simulation of humanoid motion. The simulation result of humanoid model performing SiSt mode with seesaw mechanism proved the developed models and the designed controller are able to perform and function as desired before will be implemented into FES application.},

   abstract = {Objective. The purpose of this study was to compare the kinematics, muscle activation, and force production between Parkinson's patients and healthy, age-matched participants during sit-to-stand transfers.
Design. This cross-sectional study employed a 2 x 2 x 3 multivariate analysis of variance to test for significant differences between and within groups.
Background. The underlying mechanisms that predispose an individual to lose strength during the clinical progression of Parkinson's disease have proved to be elusive, especially during performance of functional tasks such as the sit to stand transfer.
Methods. Twenty-four men (mean age: 71.5 years) categorized as Parkinson's patients (n = 13) and healthy adults (n = 11) participated in this study. Two force platforms measured antero-posterior and vertical force components as well as peak torque. Muscle activation was measured by a six channel, bilateral electromyography system. A lower-body kinematic assessment was conducted utilizing a highspeed motion analysis system.
Results. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for the outcome variables measured. However, Parkinson's patients did exhibit significant within-group bilateral differences for the variables of knee angle at seat-off, peak vertical force and peak torque.
Conclusion. Data from this study reveal that persons with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease exhibit moderately altered bilateral mechanics when performing a sit to stand transfer compared to their healthy peers.},

   abstract = {Myoelectric signals recorded via surface electrodes contain rich muscle activity information that is beneficial for both clinical diagnosis and biomedical research. When synchronized with the kinematic data, these signals provide investigators an insight into muscle activation sequence, onset, levels, and periods. A primary difficulty with the analysis and interpretation of electromyography (EMG) signals lies in the inherent stochastic nature of the EMG process, which arises from its biological variability as well as noise added during the collection process. Various techniques for muscle onset and activity detection from the myoelectric signal have been proposed in the literature. Our focus in this study is myoelectric activity detection from EMG signals collected during Sit-to-Stand (STS) and Stand-to-Sit (STST) movements. We explore a previously established double threshold detection method, and compare its results with a novel detection scheme based on the energy of the signal. Accordingly, EMG signals from four lower extremity muscles, and synchronized kinematic data, were collected for 180 trials of STS and STST movements performed in the laboratory. Detection thresholds above baseline in the case of both algorithms were computed and analyzed using a 2 (detectors) x 4 (activity thresholds) repeated measures analysis of variance. Our statistical analysis revealed that the energy detection method performed similarly to the double threshold method, while both methods required a considerably higher threshold above baseline for detection.

   abstract = {Human biomechanical movements are complex physiological tasks which are efficiently regulated by the central nervous system (CNS). Proprioceptors (muscle spindles) provide feedback of fascicle length and velocity from a joint to CNS, which then control the entire movement. These feedbacks have delays which are accounted for by the required output command. In this study, we used a four-link sagittal plane nonlinear biomechanical model with three joint angles, to simulate human sit-to-stand (STS) movement in the presence of these physiological latencies. Ankle, knee and hip joint angles have delays for angular and velocity feedbacks. We linearized the whole model using pade approximation at sitting and standing positions which resulted in two eighteenth order linear systems. We integrated these local models into a fuzzy model with Gaussian membership function. The knee flexion angle during sit to stand movement provides the criterion for determining the weights of fuzzy membership functions. We developed a H-2 dynamic optimal controller for each local linear model and integrated with the fuzzy model. This controller computed the joint's torque or inputs for biomechanical STS task. We also introduced a reference trajectory to track the knee flexion angle error for smooth and physiological relevant sit to stand transfer. Simulation results of angular profiles and kinematics variables demonstrate the applicability of the fuzzy modeling with H-2 controller in the presence of feedback latencies.},

Using an oriented projective three space with a Clifford Algebra, all these three features are handled in a similar fashion. Furthermore, issues related to uniqueness of computations and minimum number of required features are discussed. It is shown that contrary to the common intuition, specification of a minimum of four points (planes) or three lines are necessary for computation of a unique displacement. Only when the sense of the orientations of these features are specified then the minimum number of required features reduces to three for points and planes and two for lines.

   abstract = {The Sit-to-Stand (STS) is an activity most people perform numerous times daily. Standing up deals with the transition from two stabilized postures, namely seated to standing, with movement of all body segments except the feet. During the STS the body's Center of Gravity (COG) is moved upward from a sitting position to a standing position without losing balance and requiring a good coordination of many muscles. Three main phases of the STS movement can be recognized. One begins to stand up by inclining the upper body forward, which moves body mass toward the feet in order to maintain balance after lift-off. Prior to leaving the chair, hip and knee extensor muscles are activated to provide antigravity support for these joints, this action is commonly referred to as "weight shift". Finally, after leaving the chair, the leg and trunk joints are straightened to achieve upright stance. The STS task can be considered of major importance for impaired and elderly people to achieve minimal mobility and independence. In this paper we detail a procedure for the design of assisting devices to be used for the STS. In particular, an experimental procedure is described firstly to track and record point trajectories and the orientation of the trunk during the STS. This analysis is then used to get information for the design of assisting devices. A proposal and simulation results are presented for a novel mechatronic system. In particular, for the case under study experimental tests are used to drive the actuation system for the reported simulation. A functional mechatronic scheme is then proposed to control the device during its operation.},

Sensor-based assessment of peak power during the sit-to-stand (STS) transfer may be useful for detecting changes in mobility and fall risk. Therefore, this study investigated whether sensor-based STS peak power and related measures are sensitive to the effects of increasing leg strength, leg power and overall balance in older adults. A further aim was to compare sensitivity between sensor-based STS measures and standard clinical measures of leg strength, leg power, balance, mobility and fall risk, following an exercise-based intervention. To achieve these aims, 26 older adults (age: 70-84 years) participated in an eight-week exercise program aimed at improving leg strength, leg power and balance. Before and after the intervention, performance on normal and fast STS transfers was evaluated with a hybrid motion sensor worn on the hip. In addition, standard clinical tests (isometric quadriceps strength, Timed Up and Go test, Berg Balance Scale) were performed. Standard clinical tests as well as sensor-based measures of peak power, maximal velocity and duration of normal and fast STS showed significant improvements. Sensor-based measurement of peak power, maximal velocity and duration of normal STS demonstrated a higher sensitivity (absolute standardized response mean (SRM): >= 0.69) to the effects of training leg strength, leg power and balance than standard clinical measures (absolute SRM: <= 0.61). Therefore, the presented sensor-based method appears to be useful for detecting changes in mobility and fall risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ten healthy young female adults (20-23 years) and 31 older adults (21 females; 73-94 years) participated in two assessment sessions separated by 3-8 days. Vertical peak power was assessed during three (young adults) and five (older adults) normal and fast STS trials with a hybrid motion sensor worn on the hip. Older adults also performed the FTSST and TUGT. The average sensor-based STS peak power of the normal STS trials and the average sensor-based STS peak power of the fast STS trials showed excellent test-retest reliability in young adults (intra-class correlation (ICC) >= 0.90; zero in 95% confidence interval of mean difference between test and retest (95%CI of D); standard error of measurement (SEM) <= 6.7% of mean peak power) and older adults (ICC >= 0.91; zero in 95% CI of D; SEM <= 9.9%). Test-retest reliability of sensor-based STS peak power and TUGT (ICC = 0.98; zero in 95% CI of D; SEM = 8.5%) was comparable in older adults, test-retest reliability of the FTSST was lower (ICC = 0.73; zero outside 95% CI of D; SEM = 14.4%).

However, it is unclear how sensor-based measures of STS performance relate to functional status in older adults. Therefore, this study investigated the associations between sensor-based STS measures and standard clinical measures of functional status in older adults. Participants (24 females, 12 males; 72-94 years) performed five normal STS movements while wearing motion sensors on the hip and chest. Objective measures were used to assess mobility (Timed-Up-and-Go Test, Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, Stair Walk Test) and quadriceps strength. Self-reported questionnaires were used to assess limitations in activities of daily living (Groningen Activity Restriction Scale) and frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator). In general, chest STS measures showed a larger number of significant associations and stronger associations with clinical measures than hip STS measures. Chest maximal velocity, chest peak power, chest scaled peak power and chest stabilization phase SD demonstrated significant associations (weak to strong) with all six clinical measures. Noteworthy is that hip stabilization phase SD showed significant associations (weak to moderate) with five clinical measures. In particular chest peak power and chest scaled peak power demonstrated a moderate ability to discriminate between higher and lower functioning individuals (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.75-0.90). This study shows that in particular chest STS measures are indicative of objective and self-reported aspects of functional status in older adults. These findings support the clinical relevance of sensor-based monitoring of STS performance in older persons. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, the accuracy and concurrent validity of sensor-based estimations of the body's center of mass (CoM) motion during STS are unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the accuracy and concurrent validity of sensor-based measures of CoM motion during STS in older adults. Accuracy and concurrent validity were investigated by comparing the sensor-based method to a force plate method. Twenty-seven older adults (20 females, 7 males; age: 72-94 years) performed five STS movements while data were collected with force plates and motion sensors on the hip and chest. Hip maximal acceleration provided an accurate estimation of the center of mass (CoM) maximal acceleration (limits of agreement (LOA) smaller than 5% of the CoM maximal acceleration; estimated and real CoM maximal acceleration did not differ (p = 0.823)). Other hip STS measures and the chest STS measures did not provide accurate estimations of CoM motion (LOA ranged from -155.6% to 333.3% of the CoM value; sensor-based measures overestimated CoM motion (range p: <0.001 to 0.01)). However, the hip sensor did not overestimate maximal jerk of the CoM (p = 0.679). Moderate to very strong associations were observed between sensor-based estimations and actual CoM motion (range r = 0.64-0.94, p < 0.001). Hence, sensor-based estimations of CoM motion during STS are possible, but accuracy is limited. The sensor-based method cannot replace laboratory methods for a mechanical analysis of CoM motion during STS but it may be a practical alternative for the clinical assessment of STS performance in older persons.

   abstract = {Background. Early discharge from a rehabilitation center is only possible, if patients are able to do basic transfers independently (e. g., get up from bed and walk to the toilet). Against this background, the Lie-to-Sit-to-Stand-to-Walk Transfer (LSSWT) test was developed in order to quantify complex transfer abilities in older adults. This study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of this instrument.
Material and methods. A total of 24 older patients (80.25+/-8.10 years) of a geriatric rehabilitation unit performed the LSSWT test. Expert ratings were used to measure criterion validity. The Timed Up & Go test (TUG) was administered to assess construct validity. Furthermore, the time score of the LSSWT test was correlated with the Trunk Control Test (TCT), balance performance, the Chair Stand Test (CST) and gait speed. Intra-and interrater reliability were measured, conducting the LSSWT test on consecutive days.
Results. The coefficients of correlation between the LSSWT test and the expert ratings as well as the TUG test were r=-0.82 and r=0.83, respectively. Furthermore, the association with the TCT, balance, CST, and gait speed were r=-0.51, r=-0.45, r=0.47, and r=-0.72, respectively. The results of intrarater reliability and interrater reliability were ICC=0.96 and ICC=0.77, respectively.
Conclusion. The study shows that the LSSWT test is a valid measure for quantifying difficulties in transfer abilities of patients during geriatric rehabilitation. The good correlation between LSSWT test and TUG test indicates good construct validity, but also that the LSSWT test provides additional information. Interrater reliability was moderate; therefore, the training of the supervisors should be re-evaluated. Further research is needed to establish cut-off values for discharge decision and to analyze the use of the LSSWT test in different subgroups.},

   abstract = {Background: Successfully identifying older adults with a high risk of falling can be complicated, time consuming and not feasible in daily medical practice. This study compared the effectiveness of the Minimal Chair Height Standing Ability Test (MCHSAT) and 5-repetition sit-to-stand tst (5R-STS) as fall risk-screening instruments for the elderly.
Methods: 167 community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 83.6 +/- 7.3 years) were interviewed for demographics, fall history, cognition, and mobility status. MCHSAT performance was assessed using a chair whose seat height was modifiable by increments of 5 cm, starting at 47 cm and lowering after each successful attempt. 5R-STS performance was assessed by recording the time it took to rise and sit back down five consecutive times from a chair of 47 cm high. Operating Receiving Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area under the Curve (AUC) were calculated for each test as well as for sub-groups of participants classified based on medical comorbidities (e.g. cardiac disease/stroke, lower limb arthritis).
Results: The MCHSAT and 5R-STS were equally effective fall-risk screening instruments for the overall population (AUC (95% CI) = 0.72 (0.63-0.82) and 0.73(0.64-0.81) respectively). The 5R-STS was more effective than the MCHSAT for participants suffering from lower limb arthritis (AUC (95% CI) = 0.81(0.70-0.92) and 0.71(0.58-0.85) respectively) while the opposite was true for participants with a history of cardiac disease or stroke (AUC (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.44-0.80) and 0.65 (0.47-0.84) respectively).
Conclusion: Due to their simplicity and quick administration time, the MCHSAT and 5R-STS are equally suitable for implementation in clinical settings. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

From the effector geometry, we derived a mathematical model relating body segment angles and their angular velocities (i.e. state space) to CM angular and linear momentum. We used this model to partition the variability of joint angle and joint velocity configurations into combinations that leave CM momentum invariant and combinations that do not leave CM momentum invariant. The results revealed that subjects used a range of different state-space combinations from trial to trial that were equivalent with respect to producing a stable value of angular and linear momentum. In contrast, body segment combinations that changed the value of momentum were more restricted. Most interesting was the finding that, when standing up under more challenging support surface conditions, the range of state-space combinations used to stabilize momentum was increased. That is, variability increased most strongly for those angle and angular velocity combinations that left CM momentum invariant, with smaller increases registered for combinations that affected CM momentum.

Although the exoskeleton shows potential, it is not yet applied extensively in clinical rehabilitation. In this research, a fuzzy based control algorithm is proposed for lower limb exoskeletons during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) are acquired from the vastus lateralis muscle using a wearable EMG sensor. The resultant acceleration angle along the z-axis is determined from a kinematics sensor. Twenty volunteers were chosen to perform the experiments. The whole experiment was accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, acceleration angles and EMG data were acquired from the volunteers during both sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions. During sit-to-stand movements, the average acceleration angle at activation was 11 degrees-48 degrees and the EMG varied from -0.19 mV to +0.19 mV. On the other hand, during stand-to-sit movements, the average acceleration angle was found to be 57.5 degrees-108 degrees at the activation point and the EMG varied from -0.32 mV to +0.32 mV. In the second phase, a fuzzy controller was designed from the experimental data. The controller was tested and validated with both offline and real time data using LabVIEW.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a general method to estimate unmeasured external contact loads (ECLs) acting on a system whose kinematics and inertial properties are known. This method is dedicated to underdetermined problems, e.g. when the system has two or more unmeasured external contact wrenches. It is based on inverse dynamics and a quadratic optimization, and is therefore relatively simple, computationally cost effective and robust. Net joint loads (NJLs) are included as variables of the problem, and thus could be estimated in the same procedure as the ECL and be used within the cost function.
The proposed method is tested on human sit-to-stand maneuvers performed holding a handle with one hand, i.e. asymmetrical movements with multiples external contacts. Three sets of measured and unmeasured contact load components and three cost functions are considered and simulated results are compared to experimental data. For the population and movement studied, better results are obtained for a least-square sharing between actuated degrees-of-freedom of the relative motor torques (motor torques normalized by the maximal torque production capacity). Moreover, the number of unknown ECL components does not significantly influence the results. In particular, measuring only the vertical force under the seat lead to a relatively correct estimation of the ECL and NJT: not only the values of R-% were small (about 10% for the feet ECL and 20% for the NJT), but the influence of an experimental parameters (the Seat Height) was also correctly predicted.

Kinematic constraints are applied to describe movement sequences, thus reducing the dimension of the phase space. This dimensional reduction allows us to apply theorems of topological dynamics for two-dimensional systems to arrive at a classification of six possible movement strategies, distinguished by the topology of their corresponding phase portrait. Since movement is treated in terms of topological structure rather than specific trajectories, individual variations are automatically included, and the approach is by nature model independent. Pathological movement is investigated, and this method clarifies how subtle abnormalities in movement lead to difficulties in achieving a stable stance upon rising from a seated position.},

   abstract = {In the present study 10 healthy subjects were measured, performing sit-to-stand transfers in a natural way. Starting position and speed of movement were standardized. Sagittal kinematics, the ground reaction force, and muscle activity of nine leg muscles were recorded. During sit-to-stand transfer the mass centre of the body was moved forward and upward. Based on the velocity of the mass centre of the body three phases were distinguished. In horizontal direction forward rotation of the upper body contributed to the velocity of the mass centre of the body, whereas extension of the legs contributed considerably in vertical direction. After seat-off most muscles were concentrically active, whereas the shortening velocity of the rectus femoris was very low. Thus hip and knee joints were extended and a relatively high knee moment was delivered to control the ground reaction force in a slightly backward direction. Co-contraction of hamstrings and rectus femoris in sit-to-stand transfer was judged to be efficient.
Relevance
To identify disability problems in the performance of sit-to-stand transfer a complete set of normative data on kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activation during sit-to-stand transfer is needed. Moreover, to analyse these problems or to evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions, some understanding of the complex biomechanics underlying the performance of normal sit-to-stand transfer is required.},

As this functional task is essential for human independence, STS performance has been studied in the past decades using several methods, including electromyography. The aim of this study was to measure muscular activity and fatigue during different repetitions and speeds of STS tasks using surface electromyography in lower-limb and trunk muscles. This cross-sectional study recruited 30 healthy young adults. Average muscle activation, percentage of maximum voluntary contraction, muscle involvement in motion and fatigue were measured using surface electrodes placed on the medial gastrocnemius (MG), biceps femoris (BF), vastus medialis of the quadriceps (QM), the abdominal rectus (AR), erector spinae (ES), rectus femoris (RF), soleus (SO) and the tibialis anterior (TA). Five-repetition STS, 10-repetition STS and 30-second STS variants were performed. MG, BF, QM, ES and RF muscles showed differences in muscle activation, while QM, AR and ES muscles showed significant differences in MVC percentage. Also, significant differences in fatigue were found in QM muscle between different STS tests. There was no statistically significant fatigue in the BF, MG and SO muscles of the leg although there appeared to be a trend of increasing fatigue. These results could be useful in describing the functional movements of the STS test used in rehabilitation programs, notwithstanding that they were measured in healthy young subjects.},

Setting participants homes.
Design community-dwelling older adults >= 80 years of age were invited to participate in a randomised controlled clinical trial. Baseline and outcome measures were: comfortable gait velocity, 30-s chair-stand test, 15-s step test, Berg Balance Scale, Modified Falls Efficacy Scale and the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrumentfunction component. Participants randomised to the intervention group performed repeated sit-to-stands using a GrandStand System (TM); a biofeedback device that recorded and displayed the number of repetitions performed. Participants randomised to the control group performed knee extensions using ankle cuff weights. Both groups performed the exercises daily for 6 weeks.
Results sixty-six older adults took part. The intervention group had a statistically significant improvement in Berg Balance Scale mean score, 1.67 +/- 2.64 points, P=0.001 (control group 0.73 +/- 3.63 points, P=0.258), indicating an improvement in balance over the 6-week exercise period. There was no statistically significant effect of either intervention on the other outcome measures.
Conclusions in a highly variable population of older adults with mobility limitations, low-intensity functional home exercise of repeated sit-to-stands using the GrandStand System (TM) improved Berg Balance Scale score while low-intensity progressive resistance training did not. While statistically significant, the improvement in Berg Balance Scale score was modest raising the issue of what extent of change in score is clinically significant in this population.},

   abstract = {Background. The asymmetrical motor pattern of persons with hemiparesis influences the performance of activities that require interactions between the two sides of the body.
Methods. Twelve subjects with a chronic hemiparesis were asked to stand up and sit down at their natural speed in the following foot positions: (1) spontaneous; (2) symmetrical, (3) asymmetrical with the affected foot placed backward: and (4) asymmetrical with the unaffected foot placed backward. Forces were recorded under each foot using two force plates and under each thigh with an instrumented chair. Each foot position was tested at two chair heights corresponding to 100% and 120% of leg length. For each condition, the duration and the asymmetry of loading expressed by the vertical forces were calculated for four different events: onset, transition (forces under feet and thighs), seat-off or seat-on and at the end of the task.
Findings. The time to execute the tasks ranged from 2.31 s to 3.69 s with higher values observed for the stand-to-sit task than for the sit-to-stand task. Overall, the asymmetry of vertical forces was greatest in the middle part of the tasks and was not influenced by the chair height. When the subjects were still in contact with the seat, the loading asymmetry originated from a difference between sides at both the thigh and the foot. The asymmetrical foot position with the affected foot backward promoted loading on the affected side during both tasks.
Interpretation. This study shows that loading asymmetry was present before seat-off and after seat-on in sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks, respectively. It shows that positioning the affected foot behind reduces the asymmetry whereas positioning the unaffected foot behind increases the asymmetry. Foot position should be taken into consideration when clinicians assess or train for these mobility tasks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. No study has reported the differences between sides in the net muscular moment of lower limbs of subjects with hemiparesis during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks in various foot positions. Moreover, the asymmetry of lower-joint moments has not yet been related to muscular weakness of the lower limbs in this population.
Methods. A convenience sample of 12 individuals (mean age (standard deviation): 49.7 (9.0) years) with chronic hemiparesis due to stroke were asked to stand up and sit down at their natural speed in four foot positions. The joint moments at the hip and knee on both sides during the tasks were estimated with an inverse dynamic approach while the dynamic concentric strength in extension at the hip and knee was assessed with a Biodex dynamometric system. Statistical analyses (paired t-tests and ANOVAs) were used to assess the effects of sides and foot position factor on the asymmetry in the hip and knee joint moments. The level of association between muscle weakness and the asymmetry in the joint moments was quantified with Pearson correlation coefficients (r).
Findings. At the knee, the extensor moments were significantly lower on the affected side (P < 0.05) and were affected by the foot position. At the hip, the moments were not significantly different between sides and were slightly modified by the foot positions. There were also strong correlations (0.70 < r < 0.89; P < 0.05, for symmetrical foot position) between the asymmetry in knee extensor moments and the asymmetry in strength. No relation was established at the hip.
Interpretation. The sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks are characterized by a marked asymmetry in the knee extensor moments, which is associated with knee extensor weakness. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Whilst some aspects of equipment use have been addressed in health care, few studies have considered physiotherapy activities. This study aimed to establish whether equipment could be used to replace the manually assisted rising component of patient sit-to-stand treatment activities.
Design Four types of equipment were evaluated: a chair lifter, a stand-and-turn aid, a stand-and-walk aid and a walking harness. The equipment was evaluated according to a randomized, balanced presentation order.
Setting Two hospitals specializing in patient rehabilitation.
Participants A convenience sample of 10 physiotherapists and 10 patients who needed assistance to stand.
Main outcome measures Perceived rate of exertion, stability, ease of use, effectiveness, posture and duration of task. Qualitative data were collected via a focus group discussion with the physiotherapists.
Results The task duration varied significantly between equipment types, with the walking harness taking nearly 4 minutes (95% confidence interval 3-6 minutes) to use and the chair lifter taking I minute (95% confidence interval 0.5-1 minute). There were no significant differences between conditions for other variables, although the chair lifter and the walking harness were found to result in a high risk of musculoskeletal injury. The physiotherapists suggested that equipment could complement treatment activities, and recommended a variable-speed option to meet individual patient's needs. The multi-functional design of the stand-and-walk aid and the walking harness was preferred for early treatment activities, whereas treatment carryover could be enhanced with the chair lifter and the stand-and-turn aid in functional situations.
Conclusions Equipment can be used to complement manual assistance during treatment activities and is preferable to poorly performed techniques. Further studies are indicated for more specific guidance on patient selection, treatment progression and effect on physiotherapists' posture. (c) 2004 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

   abstract = {The purpose of this work is to develop a computational model to describe the task of sit to stand (STS). STS is an important movement skill which is frequently performed in human daily activities, but has rarely been studied from the perspective of optimization principles. In this study, we compared the recorded trajectories of STS with the trajectories generated by several conventional optimization-based models (i.e., minimum torque, minimum torque change and kinetic energy cost models) and also with the trajectories produced by a novel multi-phase cost model (MPCM). In the MPCM, we suggested that any complex task, such as STS, is decomposable into successive motion phases, so that each phase requires a distinct strategy to be performed. In this way, we proposed a multi-phase cost function to describe the STS task. The results revealed that the conventional optimization-based models failed to correctly predict the invariable features of STS, such as hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion movements. However, the MPCM not only predicted the general features of STS with a sufficient accuracy, but also showed a potential flexibility to distinguish between the movement strategies from one subject to the other. According to the results, it seems plausible to hypothesize that the central nervous system might apply different strategies when planning different phases of a complex task. The application areas of the proposed model could be generating optimized trajectories of STS for clinical applications (such as functional electrical stimulation) or providing clinical and engineering insights to develop more efficient rehabilitation devices and protocols.},

In this case, the capability of Central Nervous System (CNS) in generating a large repertoire of actions can be inspirational to develop more efficient motion planning approaches. Here, inspired by structural and functional modularity in the CNS, a novel modular and hierarchical model is developed to plan the sit-to-stand (STS) transfer under varying environmental conditions. In this model, the planning process is distributed among several functionally simple modules. The cooperation of modules enables the model to plan the motion under a variety of conditions. The proposed model is assessed by planning the STS transfer under two types of environmental conditions: varying seat heights and varying base of support areas. The results revealed a suitable fit between the planned trajectories and the experimental trajectories for different conditions. It is demonstrated that a modular motion planner provides a higher accuracy and flexibility for the model to extend the planning process to various new conditions, yet still requires less computational complexity when compared with previous approaches. The proposed model is also supported by several behavioral and neurophysiological evidences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. In this study the effect of a changed load/capacity ratio on sit-to-stand performance and on the underlying net joint moments was investigated. In subjects with muscle weakness the load/capacity ratio is increased due to reduced muscle capacity. In the current study this ratio was manipulated by changing the load. This approach allowed studying the isolated effect of an increased load/capacity ratio on sit-to-stand strategy.
Methods. Ten healthy women performed sit-to-stand movements under four load conditions. The load/capacity ratio was manipulated by adding 0%, 15%, 30% and 45% of the body mass to a weight vest. To determine changes in sit-to-stand strategy flexion of the trunk and temporal characteristics were assessed. Joint moments at ankle, knee and hip joints and activation patterns of major leg muscles were determined from the kinematics and kinetics.
Findings. Increasing the extra load from 30% to 45% changed the sit-to-stand performance. In the 45% condition maximal trunk flexion was increased and movement time significantly elongated. The strategy change was associated with a disproportionate increase of the net hip extension moment and a delayed peak of the net knee extension moment.
Interpretation. This study shows that experimentally observed changes in sit-to-stand strategy can be attributed to an increase in the load/capacity ratio. For treatment purposes this implies that increasing muscle strength, reducing body mass or a combination of these could be a suitable approach to improve sit-to-stand performance. The experimental model applied will be useful to study the isolated effect of the load/capacity ratio. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A systematic computational approach that can select the best configuration based on kinetostatic design specifications is presented here. This is a serendipitous result that transpired when two well-developed design techniques for compliant mechanisms were combined. A number of examples with nonintuitive design specifications are included to illustrate the new approach to the number synthesis. The examples also illustrate that the kinematic behavior is aptly captured in the elastic mechanics-based topology optimization method to compliant mechanism design. Dimensional synthesis is also accomplished in the same procedure, which is an added benefit of this approach.},

Twenty-one community-dwelling elders (65-85 years) participated. The mean times required to complete five STS repetitions at each test session were 13.2, 12.0, and 10.9 seconds. The times were reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.82) but were significantly different (F = 6.889, p = 0.003) and demonstrated a linear trend over sessions (F = 10.157, p = 0.005). The technical error of the measurement for the times ranged from 1.7 to 2.8 seconds. Although the intraclass correlation coefficient showed the STS measurement to possess good reliability, the significant difference and trend over time suggests that subjects may experience some test familiarization with repeated performance. Given this possibility and the technical error of the measurement, clinicians should be cautious in equating small decreases in STS time to real improvement.},

Subjects rose from chairs set at four heights relative to knee height, Motion was quantified using a bilateral active-marker-based motion analysis system. Subjects appeared to increase trunk flexion angular velocity to overcome mechanical difficulties of decreasing chair heights. This variable showed a main effect for chair height (P = 0.0001). Time at which knee, hip, and trunk extension angular velocity were attained each demonstrated a chair by age interaction effect (P < 0.05), Synchrony of body segment maximum extension angular velocities was altered for the older subjects at the lowest chair heights, suggesting that older individuals begin to change their performance as the task becomes more demanding.
Relevance-Sitting to standing is one of the essential physical tasks used frequently throughout the day. Clinicians are frequently called upon to improve chair rise performance for those with functional limitations. Efforts are likely to be most successful if clinicians understand how healthy individuals accommodate to changing conditions (such as changing chair height) and use that information to interpret the performance of those with impairments and functional limitations.},

   abstract = {Background. Muscle size and strength decrease with aging, and the resultant muscle weakness has been implicated in increased risk of falls in older adults. These falls have large economic and functional costs.
Methods. The purpose of this randomized, controlled study was to determine if an 8-week, 3-day per week intense (77.8 +/- 3.4% of 1-repetition maximum [1RM]) strength training program could improve functional ability related to the risk of falling in subjects aged 61-87 years (mean 72, SD 6.3). Twelve strength-training-naive subjects performed two sets of 10 repetitions for six lower body exercises while 12 subjects served as nonintervention controls. Subjects were tested pre-, mid-, and postintervention for strength gain and on three tests of functional ability.
Results. Postintervention strength was significantly better (p < .017) in all training subjects across all exercises, and no injuries were reported as a result of either training or 1RM testing. After controlling for preintervention differences, repeated measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found a significant difference between experimental and nonintervention control subjects for postintervention maximal walking speed [F(1,19) = 5.03, p < .05]. There were no significant between-group differences for 1-leg blind balance time or 5-repetition sil-to-stand performance [F(1,19) = .082; F(1,19) = .068, respectively, p > .05].
Conclusions. These findings suggest that strength training alone does not appear to enhance standing balance or sit-to-stand performance in active, community-dwelling older adults but that it may improve maximal walking speed. The relationship between strength gain and risk of falls remains unclear. The data do reinforce the notion that intense strength training is a safe and effective way to increase muscle strength in this population.},

Special focus is on robustness, since the error of position and orientation data provided by the robot can be large depending on the movement actually executed. Another inherent problem to all hand-eye calibration methods is that non-parallel rotation axes must be used; otherwise, the calibration will fail. Thus we propose a method for increasing the numerical stability by selecting an optimal set of relative movements from the recorded sequence. Experimental evaluation shows the error in the estimated transformation when using well-suited and ill-suited data. Additionally, we show how a RANSAC approach can be used for eliminating the erroneous robot data from the selected movements.},

Although this assumption of bilateral symmetry is prominent, few studies have validated this supposition. This pilot study uniquely quantifies peak joint moments and ground reaction forces (GRFs), using a Euclidian norm approach, to evaluate bilateral symmetry and its relation to lower limb motor-dominance during sit to stand in ten healthy males. Peak joint moments and GRFs were determined using a motion capture system and inverse dynamics. This analysis included joint moment contributions from all three body planes (sagittal, coronal, and axial) as well as vertical and shearing GRFs. A paired, one-tailed t test was used, suggesting asymmetrical joint moment development in all three lower extremity joints as well as GRFs (P < .05). Furthermore, using an unpaired two-tailed t test, asymmetry developed during these movements does not appear to be predictable by participants' lower limb motor-dominance (P < .025). Consequently, when evaluating sit-to-stand it is suggested the effects of asymmetry be considered in the interpretation of data. The absence of a relationship between dominance and asymmetry prevents the suggestion that one side can be tested to infer behavior of the contralateral.},

   abstract = {Sit-to-stand transfer (STS) is a common yet critical prerequisite for many daily tasks. Literature conducted on healthy STS often assume the body to behave symmetrically across the left and right side; yet only a few studies have been conducted to investigate this supposition. These studies have focused on a single numerical indicator such as peak joint moment (JM) values to describe symmetricity; however, STS is a dynamic and time dependent movement. This study addresses the validity of peak value analyses through the introduction of a time based peak-offset measure and proposes two time-dependent techniques to further characterize asymmetry and assesses their feasibility in ten (10) healthy male participants. JM and joint power (JP) over the whole STS movement was determined using motion capture and inverse dynamics. Using a paired one-tailed t-test differences were found in the time at which the left and right side reached peak values in all lower extremity joints (p < 0.05) with exception of the hip JM. Using a measure of JM and JP straight-difference it was determined that the ankle joint displayed the largest number of JM and JP development strategies of all the lower extremity joints. Finally, through numerical integration of the JM and JP data with respect to time, it was found that the longer one side spends dominating the movement, the larger the excess angular impulse and work that can be expected from that side. The results suggest that when analyzing STS movements, one must be aware of the potential asymmetry present even in healthy movements. Furthermore, a simple peak JM or JP analysis may not fully describe the extent of these asymmetries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The question of how multijoint movement is controlled can be studied by discovering how the variance of joint trajectories is structured in relation to important task-related variables. In a previous study of the sit-to-stand task, for instance, variations of body segment postures that leave the position of the body's center of mass (CM) unchanged were significantly greater than variations of body segment posture that varied the CM position. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that such structuring of joint configuration variability is accentuated when the mechanical or perceptual task demands are made more challenging. Six subjects performed the sit-to-stand task without vision (eyes closed), either on a normal or on a narrow support surface. An additional constraint on the postural task was introduced in a third condition by requiring subjects to maintain light touch (less than 1 N) with the fingertips while coming to a standing position on the narrow base of support. The joint configurations observed at each point in normalized time were analyzed with respect to trial-to-trial variability. The task variables CM and head position were used to define goal-equivalent sets of joint configurations ("uncontrolled manifolds," UCMs) within which variation of joint configuration leaves the task variables unchanged. The variability of joint configurations across trials was decomposed into components that did not affect (within the UCM) and that did affect (orthogonal to the UCM) the values of these task variables. Our results replicate the earlier finding of much larger variability in directions of joint space that leave the CM unchanged compared with directions that affect CM position. This effect was even more pronounced here than in the previous experiment, probably because of the more difficult perceptual conditions in the current study (eyes closed). When the mechanical difficulty of the task was increased, the difference between the two types of joint variability was further accentuated, primarily through increase in goal-equivalent variance. This provides evidence for the hypothesis that under challenging task constraints increased variability is selectively directed into task-irrelevant degrees of freedom. Because differential control along different directions of joint space requires coordination among joint angles, this observation supports the view that the CNS responds to increased task difficulty through enhanced coordination among degrees of freedom. The adaptive nature of this coordination is further illustrated by the similar enhanced use of goal-equivalent joint combinations to achieve a stable CM position when subjects stood up under the additional constraint of maintaining light touch with the fingertips. This was achieved by channeling goal-equivalent variability into different directions of joint configuration space.},

Experimental data collected earlier from 17 young adult and two groups of elderly subjects, 23 healthy and 11 impaired, rising from a standard chair under controlled conditions were analyzed using a planar biomechanical model. The joint torque strength requirements and the location of the floor reaction force at liftoff from the seat in the different groups and under several conditions were calculated. Analyses were also made of how body configurations and the use of hand force affect these joint torques and reaction locations.
In all three groups, the required torques at liftoff were modest compared to literature data on voluntary strengths. Among the three groups rising with the use of hands, at the time of liftoff from the seat, the impaired old subjects, on an average, placed the reaction force the most anterior, the healthy old subjects placed it intermediately and the young subjects placed it the least anterior, within the foot support area. Moreover, the results suggest that, at liftoff, all subjects placed more importance on locating the floor reaction force to achieve acceptable postural stability than on diminishing the magnitudes of the needed joint muscle strengths.},

Design: Reliability study using two measurers and two test occasions. Secondary analysis of data from two clinical trials.
Setting: Inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services in three public hospitals.
Subjects: Eighteen hospital patients and five others participated in the reliability study. Sevety-two rehabilitation unit inpatients and 80 outpatients participated in the clinical trials.
Methods: The minimum sit-to-stand height test was assessed using a standard procedure. For the reliability study, a second tester repeated the minimum sit-to-stand height test on the same day. In the inpatient clinical trial the measures were repeated two weeks later. In the outpatient trial the measures were repeated five weeks later. Knee extensor muscle strength was assessed in the clinical trials using a hand-held dynamometer.
Results: The reliability for the minimum sit-to-stand height test was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96). The standard error of measurement was 34 mm. Responsiveness was moderate in the inpatient trial (effect size: 0.53) but small in the outpatient trial (effect size: 0.16). A small proportion (8-17%) of variability in minimum sit-to-stand height test was explained by knee extensor muscle strength.
Conclusions: The minimum sit-to-stand height test has excellent reliability and moderate responsiveness in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. Responsiveness in an outpatient rehabilitation setting requires further investigation. Performance is influenced by factors other than knee extensor muscle strength.},

A detailed assessment of SiSt ability is a prerequisite for successful rehabilitation. Body fixed sensors (BFSs) are increasingly used to assess functional performances. As to date there is no system which analyzes clinically relevant phases of SiSt, the aim of this study was to determine the reliability of an automated approach for quantifying durations and angular velocities of trunk flexion and extension during repeated SiSt transitions using one BFS (DynaPort (R) Hybrid). Forty multimorbid geriatric patients aged 84.1 +/- 6.6 years were included. Each patient participated in two test sessions with a 5 min rest period in between. Intra-and interrater reliability was assessed. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), absolute and relative standard measurement errors (SEMs, SEMs%) and minimal detectable changes (MDCs95, MDCs95%) were calculated. ICCs were good to excellent for all variables in the total sample (0.80-0.94). The intraobserver group (50%) showed a higher number of excellent ICCs (>=.9) compared to the interobserver subgroup (10%). SEM% was low for all variables (6.9-12.7%). MDC95% ranged 19.2-34.4% and more variables <= 30% were found in the intra- (80%) compared to the inter-observer group (60%). Study results demonstrate that the BFS system provides a reliable analysis of SiSt phases in geriatric patients, and is a substantial improvement over the stopwatch approach used in clinical practice today.},

   abstract = {Background. Determining the relative and absolute reliability of outcomes of physical performance tests for people undergoing hemodialysis is necessary to discriminate between the true effects of exercise interventions and the inherent variability of this cohort.
Objective. The aims of this study were to assess the relative reliability of sit-to-stand-to-sit tests (the STS-10, which measures the time [in seconds] required to complete 10 full stands from a sitting position, and the STS-60, which measures the number of repetitions achieved in 60 seconds), the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the one-leg heel-rise test, and the handgrip strength test and to calculate minimal detectable change (MDC) scores in people undergoing hemodialysis.
Design. This study was a prospective, nonexperimental investigation.
Methods. Thirty-nine people undergoing hemodialysis at 2 clinics in Spain were contacted. Study participants performed the STS-10 (n=37), the STS-60 (n=37), and the 6MWT (n=36). At one of the settings, the participants also performed the one-leg heel-rise test (n=21) and the handgrip strength test (n=12) on both the right and the left sides. Participants attended 2 testing sessions 1 to 2 weeks apart.
Results. High intraclass correlation coefficients (>=.88) were found for all tests, suggesting good relative reliability. The MDC scores at 90% confidence intervals were as follows: 8.4 seconds for the STS-10, 4 repetitions for the STS-60, 66.3 m for the 6MWT, 3.4 kg for handgrip strength (force-generating capacity), 3.7 repetitions for the one-leg heel-rise test with the right leg, and 5.2 repetitions for the one-leg heel-rise test with the left leg.
Limitations. A limited sample of patients was used in this study.
Conclusions. The STS-16, STS-60, 6MWT, one-leg heel rise test, and handgrip strength test are reliable outcome measures. The MDC scores at 90% confidence intervals for these tests will help to determine whether a change is due to error or to an intervention.},

   abstract = {The goal of the present study was to determine the thus far unstudied effects of back loading on the kinematics and kinetics of sit-to-stand (STS) motion in healthy children. Fifteen children (8 boys, 7 girls, mean age 9.6 years, SD 1.2 years) were tested with no back load and with a back load of 10% and 20% of body weight, respectively. A motion analysis system was used with six infrared cameras and two force plates. Total STS duration did not change; however, differential effects were shown for the durations of its phases. Back loading increased ankle dorsiflexion yielding a greater maximal dorsiflexion angle. Effects on the knee angle were limited except for a significant decrease in final knee flexion. Initial and maximal hip flexion increased but final hip angle did not change. Initial backward pelvic tilt decreased and a shift to forward pelvic tilt occurred at an earlier stage of STS motion. Back loading affected trunk motion: maximal and final forward shoulder tilt increased. Maximal ankle and knee moments and powers increased; however, hip joint kinetics was not affected significantly. Therefore, while maintaining the general pattern of STS motion, participants showed selectively significant adjustments to back loading during its different phases. The main kinematic adjustments were increased trunk flexion and greater ankle dorsiflexion, while the major kinetic adjustment was increased knee extension moment. Increased back loading yielded more pronounced effects, primarily in the ankle. In sum, back loading substantially affected the biomechanics of STS motion even for the lower load level studied. This finding may be of clinical relevance for musculoskeletal disorders, but this needs to be examined. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, a technique for generating the volume swept by a toroidal cutter in its motion along a given tool path, is presented. This technique is based on identifying "generating curves" along the path and connecting them into a solid model of the swept volume. The swept volume simulations are verified experimentally for three test pieces. These are also compared with the simulation results from the Z-map technique. The results of the experimental verification show the method to be accurate to within 10 mu m for the three test pieces. Furthermore, the computation time for the new technique is significantly less than the Z-map method. It is concluded that the proposed method has the potential of allowing fast simulation and verification of multi-axis tool paths. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

If PAR can provide appropriate power assist, it would be more effective to adapt to human intention accordingly, otherwise, it would be a burden to human body, especially for those have difficulty in standing up and sitting down. In this paper, in order to realize proper power assist during human's standing up, a method for recognizing successive phases during a subject performing sit-to-stand motion is proposed. By using of surface electromyographic (EMG) signal sampled from lower limb combined with floor reaction force (FRF) which indicates the position of centre of gravity (COG) of some a subject, sufficient information for sit-to-stand could be recorded when the subject stands up from the chair. In succession, characteristics of the recorded signals are extracted. As it is expected for high recognition rate and rather robustness method, Neural Network Ensemble (NNE, hereafter) technology is selected to identify each phase included in standing up.},

Six subjects were videotaped as they stood up with feet on a forceplate from three initial positions:  erect sitting, trunk flexed forward 30 deg, and 60 deg.  When subjects actively flexed the trunk in the pre-extension phase, the order in which lower limb joints extended was knee, hip, ankle.  However, when there was no active flexion, the order of onsets changed, the hip extending first followed by the knee and ankle.  An extensor support moment (SM), a summation of extensor moments at hip, knee and ankle, occurred throughout the extension phase.  The mean peak value of SM remained invariant in all three conditions despite variability in individual hip, knee and ankle moments.  When active trunk flexion was absent, the duration of the extension phase was longer and a high value of SM was sustained for a longer proportion of the phase, indicating that more muscle force was required.  The findings support the view that biomechanical characteristics emerge naturally from a functional coupling between segments, according to the demands of the action.},

Under this condition, it was evident that body mass was moved the greater distance horizontally: i) by increasing the speed and amplitude of trunk flexion; and ii) by increasing the time over which the shank rotated forward at the ankle, Vertical movement of body mass was achieved largely by a 50% increase in peak moment of force at the hip, It is concluded that a forward foot placement would adversely affect the ease of standing up for individuals with leg muscle weakness and poor motor control, Since the altered biomechanical characteristics may place additional strain on the hip, patients should be cautioned to avoid standing up with feet forward after hip replacement surgery.},

The time history of the joint angles of the ankle, knee and hip were measured by optical position sensors during the motion. The experimental data when combined with human morphology, such as mass and length of each part of the body, allows the tracking of the CG position. Experiments were done on four healthy young men. Analysis shows that the motion of the CG can be clearly recognized as three motion modes: an acceleration mode and two convergent modes to an origin of the phase plane and to an equilibrium state of the standing state. Furthermore, it is suggested that the elderly usually use a spiral trajectory to the equilibrium state in the sit-to-stand movement, which is observed when a system is close to an unstable state.},

Design: Cross-sectional.
Setting: Biomechanics laboratory.
Participants: Three groups, each of 20 subjects, participated. The first group consisted of asymptomatic subjects, and the other 2 groups of consisted of LBP Subjects (duration between 7 days and 12 weeks) with and without a straight-leg raise sign.
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures: The work done and the power of the pelvis, thigh, and leg segments during STS were determined.
Results: Energy was transferred from the pelvis to the thigh segment and then to the leg segment, and this was achieved mainly by passive mechanisms. The power flow of the pelvis segment was significantly decreased in subjects with LBP. Although the power of the lower-limb segments was decreased, the total work done of these segments was increased.
Conclusions: STS is a more energy-demanding and less efficient task for subjects with LBP, either with or without a positive straight-leg raise sign. Such increases in energy demand may further exacerbate back pain, and treatment should be developed to restore a more efficient energy transfer pattern.},

Objectives. To examine differences in the kinematics and joint coordination of the lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit between healthy subjects and patients with subacute low back pain (LBP).
Summary of Background Data. There is a paucity of information on the coordination of movements of lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. The effect of LBP, with or without nerve root signs, is largely unknown.
Methods. A three-dimensional real-time electromagnetic tracking device was used to measure movements of the lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. Sixty subacute LBP participants with or without straight leg raise signs and 20 healthy asymptomatic participants were recruited. The kinematic patterns of lumbar spine and hips were analyzed. Coordination between the two joints was studied by relative phase angle analysis.
Results. The mobility of the spine and hips was significantly limited in back pain subjects. It was observed that LBP subjects employed various strategies to compensate for the limited motions at the hips and lumbar spine. The contribution of the lumbar spine relative to that of the hip was found to be reduced for subjects with LBP. The lumbar spine-hip joint coordination was significantly altered in back pain subjects, in particular, those with positive straight leg raise sign.
Conclusion. Back pain was related to changes in the kinematics and coordination of the lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. Assessment of back pain patients should include kinematic analysis of the hips as well as the spine.},

Objective. To investigate the effects of back pain, with and without limitation in straight leg raise, on the joint moment and power of the lumbar and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit.
Summary of Background Data. Movements of the lumbar spine and hips, and their coordination have been reported to be affected by the presence of low back pain (LBP), especially in those with a positive straight leg raise. However, the literature has no information concerning moment and power characteristics of the lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit in such patients.
Methods. Twenty asymptomatic subjects, 20 LBP patients, and 20 patients with LBP and a positive straight leg raise sign were requested to perform the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activities. Electromagnetic sensors were attached to the body segments to measure their kinematics while 2 nonconductive force plates gathered ground reaction force data. Biomechanical models were used to determine the muscle moments and power at the lumbosacral (L5/S1) joint and hips.
Results. Muscle moments acting at the lumbar spine and hip in the sagittal plane were found to decrease in subjects with LBP, but there were significant increases in moments in other planes of motion. The power patterns of the spine and hips were also significantly altered, particularly in subjects with a positive straight leg raise sign.
Conclusions. Back pain subjects exhibit compensatory movements and altered load sharing strategies during the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activities. Exercise therapy should take account of these changes so that the normal kinematic and kinetic characteristics of the spine and hips can be restored.},

Design. A biomechanical model describing sit-to-stand was developed using kinetic and kinematic experimental data. Trunk flexion, feet movement, knee and hip joint torques were assumed as sensible indexes to discriminate between normal and obese subjects.
Background Sit-to-stand is a functional task that may become difficult for certain patients. The analysis of its execution provides useful biomechanical information on the motor ability of selected subjects.
Methods. Sit-to-stand was recorded using an optoelectronic system and a force platform in 40 obese patients and 10 normal subjects. A biomechanical model was developed using inverse dynamics equations.
Results. Kinematic and kinetic indexes evidenced differences in motion strategy between normal and obese subjects. Obese subjects rise from the chair limiting trunk flexion (mean value: 73.1degrees) and moving their feet backwards from initial position (mean deviation: 50 mm). Normal subjects, instead, show a higher trunk flexion (mean value: 49.2degrees, a lower angular value between trunk and the horizontal means increased flexion) and fixed feet position (mean deviation: 5 min). As for kinetics, obese patients show knee joint torque higher than hip torque (maximum knee torque: 0.75 Nm/kg; maximum hip torque: 0.59 Nm/kg), while normal subjects show opposite behaviour (maximum knee torque: 0.38 Nm/kg; maximum hip torque: 0.98 Nm/kg).},

   abstract = {Introduction. Sit-to-stand (SitTS) and stand-to-sit (StandTS) are very important functional tasks that become compromised in stroke patients. As in other voluntary movements, they require an adequate postural control (PC) involving the generation of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs). In order to give clues for more efficient and directed rehabilitation programs, a deeper knowledge about APAs during challenging and daily life movements is essential.
Purpose. To analyze the activation timing of tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles during SitTS and StandTS in healthy subjects and in post-stroke patients.
Methods. Two groups participated in this study: one composed of ten healthy subjects and the other by ten subjects with a history of stroke and increased H-reflex. Electromyographic activity (EMGa) of SOL and TA was analyzed during SitTS and StandTS in the ipsilateral (IPSI) and the contralateral (CONTRA) limb to the side lesion in stroke subjects, and in one limb in healthy subjects. A force plate was used to identify the movement onset.
Results. In both sequences, in the stroke group SOL activation timing occurred prior to movement onset, contrary to the pattern observed in the healthy subjects. Statistically significant differences were found in SOL activation timings between each lower limb of the stroke and healthy groups, but no significant differences were found between the IPSI and the CONTRA limb. The TA activation timing seems to be delayed in the CONTRA limb when compared to the healthy subjects and showed a better organization of TA timing activation in StandTS when compared to SitTS.
Conclusion. Compared to healthy subjects, APAs seem to be altered in both limbs of the post-stroke subjects, with the SOL activation timing being anticipated in both SitTS and StandTS.},

   abstract = {Background. Since impairments of the trunk muscles are observed in stroke subjects, who also demonstrate limitations in performing the sit-to-stand (STS) task, it is possible that these limitations are related to decreased strength of the trunk muscles.
Aim. To compare the STS performances and isokinetic measures of trunk strength between stroke and matched healthy subjects and to investigate if there were associations between STS performances and strength of the trunk muscles.
Design. Exploratory study.
Setting. University Laboratory.
Population. Eighteen stroke and 18 matched healthy subjects.
Methods. Subjects performed the five-repetition sit-to stand test and were also asked to stand up and sit down at both self-selected and fast speeds (motion analysis system). The scores of the five-repetition sit to-stand test and the total duration of the STS, as well as the duration of phases I and II were used as measures of STS performances. Isokinetic strength of the trunk muscles was assessed at a speed of 60 degrees/s: concentric peak torque and total normalized work.
Results. Stroke subjects showed poorer STS performances (P <= 0.02), except for the duration of phase I at self-selected speed, as well as decreased strength of the trunk muscles (P <= 0.001). Significant and negative correlations were found between STS performance and trunk strength variables, which were classified as low (-0.38 <= r <=-0.49) or moderate (-0.50 <= r <=-0.63).
Conclusion. In general, poorer STS performances observed in stroke subjects was related to weakness of the trunk muscles.
Clinical Rehabilitation Impact. Evaluation and inter ventions involving trunk strength should be included in rehabilitation of stroke subjects, who show limitations in STS performances.},

   abstract = {Background: Subjects with neurological disease (ND) usually show impaired performance during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks, with a consequent reduction in their mobility levels. Objective: To determine the measurement properties and feasibility previously investigated for clinical tests that evaluate sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit in subjects with ND. Method: A systematic literature review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol was performed. Systematic literature searches of databases (MEDLINE/SCIELO/LILACS/PEDro) were performed to identify relevant studies. In all studies, the following inclusion criteria were assessed: investigation of any measurement property or the feasibility of clinical tests that evaluate sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks in subjects with ND published in any language through December 2012. The COSMIN checklist was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: Eleven studies were included. The measurement properties/feasibility were most commonly investigated for the five-repetition sit-to-stand test, which showed good test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient:ICC=0.94-0.99) for subjects with stroke, cerebral palsy and dementia. The ICC values were higher for this test than for the number of repetitions in the 30-s test. The five-repetition sit-to-stand test also showed good inter/intra-rater reliabilities (ICC=0.97-0.99) for stroke and inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.99) for subjects with Parkinson disease and incomplete spinal cord injury. For this test, the criterion-related validity for subjects with stroke, cerebral palsy and incomplete spinal cord injury was, in general, moderate (correlation=0.40-0.77), and the feasibility and safety were good for subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions: The five-repetition sit-to-stand test was used more often in subjects with ND, and most of the measurement properties were investigated and showed adequate results.},

   abstract = {Objective: Recurrent symptoms of low back pain and its transition to a chronic state are associated with specific motor strategies used by people to avoid pain. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of chronic pain intensity on sit-to-stand (STS) strategy in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients with herniated disks.
Method: Vertical ground reaction forces (counter, peak, and postpeak rebound) and their respective times of occurrence were measured on 2 Kistler force plates. Thirty-two healthy persons served as a control group. People with CLBP (n = 40) were divided into 2 subgroups according to the reported pain intensity at rest as measured by the numeric pain rating scale (NRS): low pain (NRS <= 3) and high pain (HP; NRS > 3).
Results: Both CLBP subgroups achieved shorter time to counter force but longer time to postpeak rebound force (P < .01). The time to peak force was extended in HP on the right side (P < .01). HP presented lower peak force on the right and lower postpeak rebound force on the left side (P < .001) compared with controls.
Conclusion: Patients with CLBP were characterized by an individual, compensatory STS movement strategy with shorter preparation and longer stabilization times. Avoidance behavior in STS execution was presented in HP individuals only, indicating that intensity of chronic pain was a significant factor in decreasing ground reaction peak force and increasing time to peak force.},

However, there has been little discussion about the effect of vision on sit-to-stand movement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of constrained vision on sit-to-stand movement. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-three healthy subjects (11 males, 12 females) aged 18-23 years with normal body mass indices were recruited for this study. Each participant was asked to stand as quickly as possible from a height-adjustable chair 3 times under 2 conditions: with eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO). The weight transfer time, rising index, and center of gravity sway velocity were measured using a NeuroCom Balance Master. [Results] The results show there were significant differences between the EC and EO conditions in the weight transfer time and the centre of gravity sway velocity. No significant difference was found between the EC and EO conditions in the rising index. These findings suggest that visual perception may play a role in balance control while performing sit-to-stand movement.},

Experimental measurements investigated standing-up pattern from two seat heights and at three different speeds. Body motion was measured using an optical measuring system with active markers. Floor and seat reaction forces and moments were measured by two force plates and an integrated force-moment sensor. Analysis of ankle, knee, hip and trunk inclination angles shows that STTA perform STS movement with different initial foot placement than HS, resulting in different lower extremity loadings and larger trunk inclination. Asymmetry was defined as the difference between left and right extremity parameters averaged throughout STS movement. A root-mean-square error was used to assess the asymmetry in ground reaction forces and in ankle, knee and hip angles and moments. The influence of different seat heights and velocities on asymmetry was tested using one-way ANOVA. The asymmetry of STTA and HS was affected neither in kinematic nor in kinetic parameters. Performing STS at higher speeds was found to result in decreased trunk flexion. The asymmetry assessment, as determined in this study, can be used in rehabilitation for improving STS strategies or as an evaluation tool for estimating the progress of the rehabilitation process.

   abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the sit-to-stand activity on the mobility, function, and health-related quality of life of nursing home residents with dementia.
Design: A longitudinal quasi-experimental intervention study with intervention and control groups.
Setting: The study was conducted in 7 nursing homes (4 intervention; 3 control) in Edmonton, Canada.
Participants: Eligible residents had a diagnosis of dementia and were able to transfer independently, or with the assistance of 1 person.
Intervention: Health care aides prompted residents to repeat the sit-to-stand activity daily during care routines on day and evening shifts.
Measurements: Mobility was measured using the 30-second sit-to-stand test and the time to complete one sit-to-stand. Function (Functional Independence Measure), health status (Health Utilities Index Mark 2 & 3) and disease-specific quality of life (Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease instrument) were also measured. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months. The covariates cognition, depression, and medical instability were derived from the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (Version 2.0), and the facility context covariate was measured using the Alberta Context Tool.
Results: A total of 111 residents completed the 6-month trial (56 intervention; 55 control). Residents in the intervention facilities maintained mobility, as measured by the time to complete one sit-to-stand (P - .01), and experienced a slower functional decline, as measured by the Functional Independence Measure (P - .01), from baseline to 6 months compared with residents in the control facilities, after adjusting for age, sex, cognition, depression, medical instability, and context.
Conclusions: Maintaining the ability to transfer using the sit-to-stand activity is a promising means of optimizing the mobility and function for residents with dementia in nursing homes. (C) 2015 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.},

Among persons under 80 years of age, 24% were users of assistive devices; in the 80 years or above group, this figure rose to 57%. Hygiene and mobility devices were the most common. The usage rate of assistive devices was 84%. The reasons for disuse were an improved health status, or difficulties in using the device. Sixteen percent of the study population had un-met needs of assistive devices. At follow-up visits, the subjects estimated a high degree of effectiveness when using the devices, particularly in the form of reduced difficulty and increment of safety, and increased capacity and ability in various activities. We conclude that the use of assistive devices increases with age, and that most of the assistive devices are used and are effective. As the need for assistive devices changes over time, follow-ups in the home are necessary. Therefore, to meet the needs of a growing elderly population, information about assistive technology should be supplied to both personnel in health care and in the social service system.},

   abstract = {Measurement of cerebral autoregulation is important for the evaluation and management of a number of clinical disorders that affect cerebral blood flow. We currently lack simple bedside measures that mimic common physiologic stresses. Therefore, we evaluated a new sit-to-stand technique as an alternative method to the frequently-used thigh-cuff technique in health, volunteers. Continuous middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocities (BFV) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were measured in response to standing from a sitting position, or rapid thigh-cuff deflation in 24 healthy subjects (50 +/- 22). Autoregulatory index (ARI) was calculated as the BFNI response for step changes in 6P using a second-order differential equation with a set of parameters that can be used to grade the performance of autoregulation. Of these 24 subjects, 30% could tolerate only two thigh-cuffs and refused to proceed with the third cuff, whereas none of our subjects had any difficulty with performing the three sit-to-stand trials. The two techniques produced similar changes in mean ABP, but the times to nadir of the blood pressure and BFV were significantly faster for the thigh-cuff. The mean group ARIs were similar between the two techniques. Although between-subjects variability was higher for sit-to-stand ARIs, the within-subject sit-to-stand ART variability was small. Thus, for the assessment of cerebral autoregulation, the sit-to-stand procedure is well tolerated and produces ART values that have low, within-subject variability. The sit-to-stand technique appears to be a suitable measure of individual ART values for inferring dynamic cerebral autoregulation.},

   abstract = {Individuals with quadriceps muscle weakness often have difficulty generating the knee-extension moments required to complete common mobility tasks. A new device that provides knee-extension moments through a range of knee angles was designed to help individuals perform stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand tasks. The novel knee-extension assist (KEA) was designed as a modular component to be incorporated into existing knee-ankle-foot orthoses or used in a knee orthosis. During stand-to-sit, a set of springs is loaded as the knee flexes under body weight and the KEA thus provides a knee-extension moment that aids in achieving a smoothly controlled knee flexion. The springs can be locked in place at the end of knee flexion to prevent unwanted knee extension while the user is seated. The entire knee extension assist can be disengaged to allow free joint motion anytime the affected leg is unloaded. During sit-to-stand, the KEA assists knee extension by returning the energy stored in the springs as an extension moment. In mechanical testing of a prototype of the new KEA, a mean maximum extension moment of 42.9 +/- 0.46 Nm was provided by the device during flexion and 28.4 +/- 0.28 Nm during extension. A biomechanical evaluation with two able-bodied individuals demonstrated the effectiveness of the KEA in successfully assisting stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand tasks. During stand-to-sit, the KEA provided 82% and 75% of the total (muscle and KEA) knee-extension moment required by the braced leg for the task for the two subjects, respectively; and during sit-to-stand, the KEA provided 56% and 50% of the total knee-extension moment for the two subjects, respectively. This KEA performance exceeded 50% knee-extension moment assistance for a 70 kg person.},

Seventeen volunteers participated in an intense, eccentric based, muscle damage protocol of knee flexors and extensors via an isokinetic dynamometer. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using a 10-camera optoelectronic system and a force plate 24 h before and 48 h after exercise. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in kinematic and kinetic parameters after exercise. Forty-eight hours after exercise, the strategy did change and the knee joint relative effort level increased significantly. Pelvic and hip kinematics, in conjunction with the knee extension joint moment, provided an efficient mechanism to support the participants' locomotor system during the STST. These results may be of great significance in designing supportive devices, as well as composing rehabilitation programs for young or elderly individuals, with various musculoskeletal pathologies.

The traditional Polydyne method is modified and extended to achieve significant improvement in residual vibration characteristics. First, cam displacement curves are represented by Bernstein-Bezier harmonic curves as opposed to polynomial curves. These recently developed harmonic curves are low in harmonic content and therefore the resulting cant profiles are less prone to induce resonant vibrations in the follower system. Second, the design procedure is expanded such that the residual vibrations of the resulting cam-follower system is not only extinguished at the design speed but also made insensitive to speed variations. Numerical examples are given in the end.},

The problem of fine-tuning of rational motions is studied as that of fine-tuning rational curves in a projective dual three-space, called the image curves. The path-smoothing algorithm automatically detects and smoothes out the third order geometric discontinuities in the path of a cubic rational B-spline image curve. The speed-smoothing algorithm uses a quintic rational spline image curve to obtain a second-order geometric approximation of the path of a cubic rational B-spline image curve while allowing specification of the speed and the rate of change of speed at the key points to obtain a near constant kinetic energy parameterization.

The purpose of this study was to use kinetic reference standards to identify accurate kinematic and kinetic indicators for STS movement analysis such that consistent indicators might be used for STS from varied initial postures. Healthy adults performed STS using 4 foot placements: foot-neutral, foot-back, right-staggered, and left-staggered. Kinetic and kinematic data were collected from force platforms and an 8-camera video system. Initiation, seat-off, vertical posture, and termination were detected with 5% start and 7.5% end thresholds for changes in kinetic and kinematic STS indicators. Timing differences between kinetic and kinematic indicator time points and the reference vertical seated reaction force end point (seatoff) were determined. Kinematic indicators were compared with selected kinetic indicators using timing differences, statistical similarity, and internal consistency measures. Our results suggest that a single force platform system measuring vertical GRF or a simple camera system to evaluate the shoulder marker position and velocity can accurately and consistently detect STS initiation, seat-off, and vertical posture. In addition, these suggested STS indicators for initiation, seat-off, and vertical posture were not dependent upon foot placement.},

Two groups (n = 10 per group) of women were studied (non varicosed, C0 and varicosed, C2) during twenty min periods of 6 different static posture maintenance in the sit-stand position (base, bambach, bicycle and knee), sitting and standing in a semi random order. The following measurements during each posture were taken on the left lower limb: blood perfusion (foot), transcutaneous partial pressure of O(2) and CO(2) (foot), cutaneous temperature (medial malleola), foot volume (water displacement plethysmograhy), EMG of the gastrocnemius muscle, and segment angulation (upper, lower limb and trunk). As well, urinary prostaglandins, VO(2), heart rate, vertical heart foot distance, and perception were recorded. We observed that different postures present both biomechanical and physiological advantages and disadvantages. Biomechanically, a more pronounced anteroversion was observed during standing and some sit-stand (bambach and knee) postures, while a posteroversion was observed during sitting and the remaining sit-stand (base and bicycle) postures. Physiologically, the lower limb blood perfusion was similar between sitting and the sit-stand knee posture but significantly larger when compared to standing and the remaining sit-stand postures (base, bambach and bicycle). No significant differences were observed for lower limb oedema and prostaglandin levels between all various postures (within subjects) and both groups (between subjects). In conclusion, the smaller the vertical distance between heart/foot (hydrostatic column) the better lower limb perfusion appears to be (reduction in lower limb blood pooling). In addition, static posture maintenance for a short period of time, such as 20 min, appears insufficient to initiate the cascade of physiological events that may lead to the development of varicose veins in non varicosed individuals (C0) and does not appear to exacerbate the risk of complication in varicosed individuals (C2).},

Measurements analyzed were (1) the time taken to sit down; (2) the leg joint moment; (3) the antero-posterior and vertical floor reaction forces; and (4) the range of motion of the lower limbs and trunk. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the pregnant with non-pregnant women using the Mann-Whitney U test. [Results] For pregnant women, the time taken to sit down, the knee extension moment, as well as the posterior and vertical components of the motion were significantly higher. The ranges of motion of the other joints were not significantly different between the pregnant and non-pregnant women. [Conclusion] Pregnant woman have unstable posterior balance when sitting down due to the increase of the posterior floor reaction force. In the third trimester, the sit-down motion requires attention because of the impact of weight gain and the shift in the center of gravity.},

   abstract = {Background: In the third trimester, trunk flexion movements become difficult due to abdominal enlargement. Moreover, muscle load increases when rising from a seated position (sit-to-stand) due to the increased abdominal weight. Sit-to-stand is frequently performed by working women; this activity becomes more difficult in the third trimester. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of decreasing the amount of muscle load during the third trimester with the use of a handrail and to analyze the amount of muscle load during sit-to-stand.
Methods: Eight pregnant women in their third trimester and eight non-pregnant women performed sit-to-stand from 450-mm high seats using different types of handrails (i.e., distal bar, proximal bar, one-handed handrail, and armrest). Body load measurements were based on the leg joint moment, combined floor reaction force, the angle of trunk flexion and extension, handrail reaction force, and subjective perceived strength using a 3D motion analysis system and a force plate.
Findings: With the armrest, the maximal handrail reaction force increased, and the combined floor reaction force and subjective perceived strength decreased. The bilateral leg joint moments were symmetrical. and the knee extension moment did not exceed the hip extension moment Interpretation: With the armrest, the forward and upward movements of the center of gravity were ensured by the reaction force on the armrest, and a symmetrical dispersion of the muscle's load on the legs was noted.
Relevance to industry. This study evaluates the effect of handrail for pregnant woman. As for the handrail of the restroom of the obstetrics and gynecology department, the armrest is more desirable. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. Asymmetric limb loading persists well after unilateral total hip replacement surgery and represents a risk of the development of osteoarthritis in the non-operated leg. Here we studied bilateral limb loading in hip arthroplasty patients for a variety of everyday activities.
Methods. Twenty-seven patients and 27 healthy age-matched control subjects participated in the study. They were asked to stand up from a chair, to stand quietly, to perform isometric maximal voluntary contractions and to walk along a 10 in path at a natural and fast speed. Two force platforms measured vertical forces under each foot during quiet standing and sit-to-stand maneuver. Temporal variables of gait were measured using footswitches.
Findings. In all tasks patients tended to preferentially load the non-operated limb, though the amount of asymmetry depended on the task being most prominent during standing up (inter-limb weight bearing difference exceeded 20%, independent of speed or visual conditions). In contrast, when performing maximal voluntary contractions, or during walking and quiet standing, the inter-limb difference in the maximal force production, stance/swing phase durations or weight bearing was typically less than 10%.
Interpretation. The results suggest that the amount of asymmetry might not be necessarily the same for different tasks. Asymmetric leg loading in patients can be critical during sit-to-stand maneuver in comparison with quiet standing and walking, and visual information seems to play only a minor role in the control of the weight-bearing ability. The proposed asymmetry indices might be clinically significant for development of post-surgical rehabilitation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A key issue in the creation of error-free tool path for numerically controlled (NC) surface machining is gouging (over-cut) prevention. In the case of solid-based machining, where the creation of tool paths across several surfaces in a single pass is imperative, the major sources for gouging are the tangent discontinuity (C-1 discontinuity) and the surface gap (C-0 discontinuity) occurred in the constituent surfaces of the part model. C-1 discontinuity is naturally identified in solid modeling as 'edges' and 'vertices'. C-0 discontinuity occurs, however, in the free edges of surfaces or from errors in surface definition.In this paper, a system based on the offset/upper envelope concept is proposed for solving the C-0 and C-1 discontinuity in 3-axis multi-surface NC machining. Essentially, in addition to offsets of surfaces themselves, offsets are also defined for the boundary curves of these surfaces. By incorporating the upper enveloping operation on the intersection curves between the drive planes and the offsets, it is shown that the resulting tool paths have pleasant features of gouge free, smoothness, and minimal uncut area.In addition, a detailed algorithmic description of the intersection between a drive plane and the offset of surface boundaries is also presented.},

Therefore, we have been developing a sit-to-stand assistance system equipped with a moving handrail to lead elderly and Parkinson disease people to stand up from a chair. Our system consists of handrail, a six-axis force sensor, two AC servo linear actuators, frame and a personal computer. We performed sit-to-stand movement experiments of Parkinson disease people using our system. We controlled trajectory of the handrail in three different ways: curve trajectory which is based on sit-to-stand motion of the able person, forward straight line trajectory and obliquely upward straight line trajectory. We measured the center of mass, hip joint angle, and the applied force to the handrail, and evaluated the three trajectories from the view of the assistance of sit-to-stand movement. Finally, we confirmed that Parkinson disease people could stand up smoothly using our assist system.},

   note = {10.1115/DETC2013-12969},
   abstract = {This paper develops techniques that address the design of planar four-bar linkages for tasks common to pick-and-place devices, used in assembly and manufacturing operations. Pick-and-place tasks often require the exact position and orientation of an object (motion generation) at the end points of the task. Within the range of movement, the motion restrictions are less rigorous with only the position of the object (path-point generation) being specified to avoid obstacles. Established synthesis theory has been developed for either motion generation or path-point generation tasks. This paper presents four-bar linkage synthesis methods for tasks that include a combination of motion and path requirements. This synthesis challenge is addressed via two approaches: Geometric Constraint Programming (GCP) and numerical solutions to synthesis equations. Using GCP, a step-by-step methodology has been established to find solutions to these synthesis challenges. Using numerical methods, techniques are presented to formulate kinematic chain constraint equations and solve for appropriate link lengths and pivot locations. Examples of various combinations of motion and path-point generation are presented.},

Different feedrate variations V(t) can be accommodated with minimal modifications to the core algorithm by employing a modular function call to define F(t). Such time-dependent feedrate capability is invaluable in high-speed machining applications, where it can ensure smooth acceleration and deceleration control of a CNC machine under extreme torque or power demands on the axis drives. Empirical results from implementations of these time-dependent feedrate interpolators on an open architecture 3-axis mill are presented, highlighting their exceptional performance and versatility. These results also furnish a compelling illustration of a basic defect of "traditional" (piecewise-linear/circular) G code path descriptions-namely, the fundamental conflict between geometrical path accuracy (which entails use of many short G code segments) and the accurate and smooth maintenance of rapid commanded feedrates.

The purpose of this study was to examine which GRF parameters would be more strongly associated with a person's physical functioning, history of falls, fear of falling and mobility limitations, all of which are known to be related to lower-limb muscle strength and power. We performed cross-sectional analyses on 363 community-dwelling older adults, which included 160 men and 203 women, aged 65-85 years (73.4 +/- 5.3 years). Five parameters were measured: peak reaction force, two rate of force development and two time-related parameters. Their rate of force development was relatively higher correlated with results from timed "up and go" tests, standing times from a long sitting position and 4-way choice reaction times (partial r = -0.37 similar to -0.52); these tests were accompanied with a dynamic movement of lower-limb; than their peak reaction force and time-related parameters. The rate of force development were poorer in subjects reporting falls, a fear of falling or a mobility limitation compared with those reporting no falls, fear of falling or mobility limitation. These results suggest that measuring the rate of force development in a sit-to-stand movement provide a better assessment of lower-limb muscle strength and power. (Jpn. J. Phys.

   abstract = {Background: Ground reaction force parameters in a sit-to-stand (STS) movement can be used to evaluate lower extremity function. Few reports, however, are available on whether the ground reaction force parameters in an STS movement reflect dynamic knee and ankle strength or power. The aims of this study were to examine associations among ground reaction force parameters in an STS movement and isokinetic knee and ankle strength and power in healthy older adults, and to compare associations with the five-times STS test.
Methods: The following five ground reaction force parameters were measured in 19 men and 28 women: peak reaction force, two rate of force development (RFD) parameters and two time-related parameters.
Results: RFD (Delta 90 ms)/body weight correlated significantly with average isokinetic knee extension/flexion power in both sexes (partial-r = 0.39-0.54) and average ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion power (partial-r = 0.50 and partial-r = 0.49, respectively), in women. No isokinetic parameters were significantly related to the five-times STS test.
Conclusion: Ground reaction force parameters in an STS movement can accurately reflect the dynamic strength and power in the lower limbs, which is approximately equal to or better than the strength and power reflected by the five-times STS test.

The purpose of this study is, therefore, to realize the control method of complete paraplegic patients during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers by using a 'robot suit HAL'. It is the most challenging issue because the HAL should start supporting the wearer's motions synchronizing his/her intention. Our proposed algorithm infers the intention based on a preliminary motion that is observed just before a desired motion so the patient could start the sit-to-stand or stand-to-sit transfers without any operation. When the HAL detects the intention to stand up and sit down, the HAL starts to support the wearer's weight and to control their body posture for stability during their transfer. The proposed algorithms embedded in the HAL were applied to a complete spinal cord injury patient in a clinical trial to confirm the effectiveness. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms could support his sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers safely and conveniently by keeping his stability and by reflecting his intentions. Consequently, we confirmed that the proposed method successfully supported the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers of the complete paraplegic patient with the HAL.

Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Rehabilitation medical centre.
Participants: Thirty-two subjects with stroke were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups (n = 16 for each group).
Interventions: Subjects in both groups received 30 minutes of general physical therapy three times a week for four weeks. Subjects in the experimental group received additional sit-to-stand training for 15 minutes each time. The total amount of therapy received was 45 minutes in the experimental group and 30 minutes in the control group each time.
Main outcome measures: The weight-bearing distribution during quiet standing, the directional control and maximal excursion during limits of stability test, the scores of Berg Balance Scale and the extensor muscle strength of lower extremity were assessed before and after completing the 12 treatment sessions.
Results: Our data showed significant improvements in directional control anteriorly in the experimental group (from 47.4 (36.6)% to 62.6 (26.1)%) compared with the control group (from 68.7 (16.7)% to 62.8 (29.7)%) (P = 0.028). A significant improvement in affected hip extensor strength was noted in the experimental group (from 19.3 (9.8)% to 22.6 (8.4)%) compared with the control group (from 24.4 (9.0)% to 22.8 (7.2)%) (P = 0.006). Significant improvements were noted only in the experimental group after treatment, including bilateral extensors, except the affected plantar flexors, the weight distribution in standing, the maximal excursion (P(anterior) = 0.049; P(affected) = 0.023) and the directional control (P(affected) = 0.013; P(non-affected) = 0.025).
Conclusions: Additional sit-to-stand training is encouraged due to effects on dynamic balance and extensor muscles strength in subjects with stroke.},

Systems with numerous high-impedance powered degrees of freedom commonly suffer from cumbersome walking dynamics and decreased utility due to added weight and increased control complexity. We propose a new approach to powered exoskeleton design that minimizes actuation and control complexity by embedding intelligence into the hardware. This paper describes a minimalistic system that uses a single motor for each exoskeleton leg in conjunction with a bio-inspired hip-knee coupling mechanism to enable users to walk, sit, and stand. Operating in concert with a custom orthotic knee joint, the exoskeleton hip joint has been designed to mimic the biarticular coupling of human leg muscles thus allowing a single actuator to power both hip and knee motions simultaneously. The implementation of this design resulted in a system that provides comparable performance to existing exoskeletons. This system has been tested on paraplegic subjects and has successfully enabled patients to stand up, sit down, and ambulate in numerous real world situations.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the full-body strategies utilized during a sit-to-stand (STS) task in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the association between STS alterations and clinical measurements. Twenty-five patients with advanced knee OA and twenty healthy elderly adults were recruited to participate in this study. Patients were asked to stand up from a chair four times without using their arms. A 3D motion analysis system was used to capture the full-body kinematics during the task. Two force plates were used to capture the forces under each leg. The following parameters were investigated in the knee OA group and compared with the control group: the time to realize STS, the force ratio between both limbs, the knee and hip kinetics and the trunk kinematics. The pain and functional capacity were obtained from the WOMAC. The results showed that patients with knee OA put 10% additional weight on the contralateral side when compared with the symmetrical strategy of the control group. Patients with knee OA showed a significantly lower knee flexion moment (0.51 N m/kg vs. 0.72 N m/kg), a higher maximal trunk flexion (46.4 degrees vs. 37.5 degrees), and a higher lateral trunk lean on the contralateral side (2.4 degrees vs. 0.9 degrees) when compared with the control group. The main correlations were found between pain and the averaged time to complete the STS task (r = 0.55).
With the quantification of the full-body mechanisms utilized during the STS task, which includes both distal and proximal compensations, our study brings new insights, leading to a better understanding of the functional alterations in patients with advanced knee OA.

A chair was adapted and instrumented with strain gauges and position sensors so that the force applied through the upper limbs to the arms of the chair could be calculated. Four aspects of the chair's geometry could be varied. A force plate was positioned on the floor between the legs of the chair to record the corresponding foot loading. Twenty normal subjects (22-56 years, mean 32.7 years) participated in a pilot study in which loading through the upper and lower limbs was recorded for a range of chair geometries. The vertical force transmitted through each upper limb was typically 20-30 per cent of bodyweight. The vertical upper limb load averaged across all subjects showed a small reduction when either the seat height or the height of the chair arms was increased.},

   abstract = {In the present article a method is proposed for the optimum synthesis of planar mechanisms with lower pairs and a configuration of any type. It is valid for path synthesis generation, connecting-rod guidance, function generation, and any combination on the same mechanism. The idea is to start out with a mechanism of given dimensions that is required to satisfy the synthesis conditions, allowing the deformation of its component elements. The mechanism that least needs to be deformed will be the optimum according to this criterion. The parameters of the resulting error function are the lengths of the binary elements, the triple dimensions in the tertiaries, and the positions of the nodes linked to the frame. An expansion is used in which the first and second derivatives of the error function are calculated without the use of finite-difference schemata. This expansion enables one to use a Newton method, results of which are optimized by means of linear search, and facilitates better solutions with very few iterations.},

   abstract = {Adapted strategies in rising from a chair occur with muscle weakness. To assess whether muscle weakness caused the strategy change, an experimental simulation was performed that allowed to investigate separately effects of reduced muscle capacity and of strategy change on movement dynamics. It was hypothesized that a sit-to-stand (STS) Strategy change spares muscles that become Overloaded when muscle weakness develops. Ten healthy females participated: seven of them completed all tests. Muscle weakness Causes an increased load-over-capacity ratio. In the present study, this ratio was increased by providing participants with a waist-coat containing 45% of their body mass. Participants performed sit-to-stand manoeuvres with and without added mass; moreover they were instructed to perform two different strategies, the moment-transfer-strategy and the stabilization-strategy. During these STS-tasks sagital 2D-video analysis were made and ground reaction forces (GRF) were measured. joint moments and powers for ankle, knee and hip joint were calculated. The preferred strategy under the normal condition was the moment-transfer strategy. Increasing the load without adapting the strategy resulted in significantly higher (13%) knee-joint extension moments. Allowing a strategy shift in the loaded condition spared the knee-joint extensors (-6%) and transferred effort to hip-joint extensors (57%) and plantar flexor (67%) muscles. These results suggest that the capacity of knee-joint extensors limits the STS-performance when Muscle weakness occurs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The identification of chair rise phases is a prerequisite for quantifying sit-to-stand movements. The aim of this study is to validate seat-off and seat-on detection using a single-body-fixed sensor against detection based on chair switches. A single sensor system with three accelerometers and three gyroscopes was fixed around the waist. Synchronized on-off switches were placed under the chair. Thirteen older adults were recruited from a residential care home and fifteen young adults were recruited among college students. Subjects were asked to complete two sets of five trials each. Six features of the trunk movement during seat-off and seat-on were calculated automatically, and a model was developed to predict the moment of seat-off and seat-on transitions. The predictions were validated with leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature extraction failed in two trials (0.7%). For the optimal combination of seat-off predictors, cross-validation yielded a mean error of 0 ms and a mean absolute error of 51 ms. For the best seat-on predictor, cross-validation yielded a mean error of -3 ms and a mean absolute error of 127 ms. The results of this study demonstrate that seat-off and seat-on in repeated sit-to-stand movements can be detected semi-automatically in young and older adults using a one-body-fixed sensor system with an accuracy of 51 and 127 ms, respectively. The use of the ambulatory instrumentation is feasible for non-technically trained personnel. This is an important step in the development of an automated method for the quantification of sit-to-stand movements in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Much is known about the sit-to-stand (STS) and its biomechanics. Currently, however, there is little opportunity for instrumented quantification of the STS as part of screening or diagnosis in clinical practice. The objectives of the present study were to describe the feasibility of using an automated approach for quantifying the STS using one sensor location and to start testing the discriminative validity of this approach by comparing older and younger adults. 15 older subjects recruited from a residential care home and 16 young adults performed 5 repeated sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements. They were instrumented with a small and lightweight measurement system (DynaPort (R)) containing 1 triaxial seismic accelerometer and 3 uniaxial gyroscopes fixed in a belt around the waist. Durations of the (sub-)phases of the STS were analyzed and maximum angular velocities were determined. All successful STS cycles were automatically detected without any errors. The STS duration in the older adults was significantly longer and more variable in all phases (i.e., sit-to-stand, standing, stand-to-sit and sitting) compared to the young adults. Older adults also exhibited lower trunk flexion angular velocity. The results of this first fully automated analysis of instrumented repeated STS movements demonstrate that several STS parameters can be identified that provide a basis for a more precise, quantitative study of STS performance in clinical practice.

Moreover, a high level Gaussian Mixture Model based intent recognizer is developed to distinguish between standing and sitting modes and switch the middle level controllers accordingly. Experimental results with unilateral transfemoral amputee subject show that sitting down and standing up intent can be inferred from the prosthesis sensor signals by the intent recognizer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the prosthesis generates net active power of 50 W during standing up and dissipates up to 50 W of power during stand-to-sit transition at the knee joint.},

   abstract = {We propose an original method to synthesize the dimensions of a planar mechanism (linkage) whose function is to generate a trajectory shape. Most graphical and analytical synthesis methods for path generators require specifying the desired trajectory in a non-functional manner, by a list of points rather than a pure shape. Concerning the dimensional optimization methods, they turn out to be slow and their convergence depends on the initial solution. Alternatively, we propose a case-based approach (i.e., couples of trajectories and dimensions of a given structure mechanism) using a neural network. The first stage consists in the generation of a huge case number through kinematic simulations, for random values of dimensions, and in a learning process of the neural network. In the second stage, of utilization, the neural network instantaneously makes it possible to obtain an approximate solution of the synthesis problem, which is an interpolation of close cases. We show on the four-bar linkage example the good quality of the synthesized solutions, for a tiny size of the network. Next, these solutions may be used as judicious initial solutions for a conventional dimensional optimization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These include a method based on the combination of bed and foot pressure, an image-based method and a pressure signal-based method. Challenges, limitations and results are shown for each using data collected from 10 young healthy subjects. The pressure signal-based method measures the sit-to-stand time more effectively when comparing to video data. The further development of this method is then presented; this includes analyzing the pressure signal to detect phases that make up the sit-to-stand movement and a sample result for one young healthy subject is presented.},

This study investigated differences in kinetics and kinematics to characterize the lower-limb strength and dynamic balance requirements across different pole configurations and positions in nine mobility limited older adults. Poles were varied by location (near and far) and configuration (single vertical pole, double vertical poles, vertical pole with a horizontal bar). Results indicated that the far pole condition resulted in increased trunk (p<0.001) and hip flexion (p<0.01 and < 0.0001 for contralateral and ipsilateral sides, respectively), and a reduced peak vertical force applied to the pole (p<0.001). Peak extension moments at the hip and knee were unchanged, and, therefore, pole position had no effect on task demands. Placing the pole unilaterally introduced a small kinetic asymmetry, which significantly increased peak knee extension moments on the ipsilateral side (p<0.05). Finally, dynamic balance was relatively unchanged across pole conditions. These findings offer novel insight into pole use and the effect of varying pole location and configuration in a sample of older adults with mobility impairment, and provide the basis for future work.},

   abstract = {Objectives. Personal and equipment assistance are common strategies to reduce disability. This study sought to determine how often assistance reduces or even completely resolves health-related difficulties in everyday tasks.
Methods. Data are from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study. Adults aged 35 to 90 reported difficulty doing 12 everyday tasks on their own without assistance. Those stating that they had much difficulty or were unable were asked if they had personal assistance and/or equipment assistance, and their degree of difficulty with assistance. Use and efficacy of assistance are studied by gender, age, intrinsic (unassisted) degree of difficulty, and type of assistance.
Results. Most people use assistance for the 12 tasks; ''personal assistance only'' is the principal type used for upper-extremity and body transfer tasks; ''equipment only'' ranks first for lower-extremity tasks. Assistance reduces difficulty for the great majority of persons (75% to 85%) and completely resolves difficulty for about 25%. Equipment only proves to be the most efficacious strategy for reducing and resolving limitations.
Conclusions. Equipment's success may be due to greater perceived gains when people accomplish the assistance by themselves.},

   abstract = {One of the fundamental problems arising in kinematics is that of determining object position, velocity and acceleration from given point position, velocity and acceleration data. This type of problem is frequently encountered in robotics, biomechanics, real-time control of space structures, automatic guided vehicles, etc. Complications arise when redundant data are used and when the data have errors. Chutakanonta and Gupta proposed two simple and elegant methods for the estimation of object position from the given point position data. The present work is an extension of these methods for estimating the object velocity and acceleration states from the given point position, velocity and acceleration data. The method proposed herein uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to effectively estimate the object velocity and acceleration states. Such matrix decompositions can be performed by using readily available matrix-oriented software like MATLAB and can be successfully used to simplify the solution of the over-determined system of equations encountered in these types of problems. Several hypothetical examples and examples that simulate practical situations are presented to determine the effectiveness, robustness and applicability of the proposed method. The method is found to be very effective in estimating the object velocity and acceleration states in the presence of imprecise and redundant data as well as for nearly co-planar point data.},

The sit-to-stand movement is selected and analyzed, in order to illustrate how a special form of physical therapy known as. the Alexander Technique can effectively reduce the loads placed on the joints. Because force and moment sensors cannot be implemented to take direct measurements within the joints, we used a motion analysis system to analyze information about body position and then input the data into ADAMS models to estimate the reaction forces and moments on the joints. Furthermore, an optimal control algorithm is introduced to quantitatively identify the optimal contours of the movements. By analyzing the reactions of the joints, this paper demonstrates that better moving tracks are beneficial for reducing body loads.},

A bicompartmental knee replacement system replaces these two affected knee compartments and keeps the lateral compartment and cruciate ligaments intact. It is yet to be determined whether limbs with bicompartmental knee systems can demonstrate frontal-plane knee mechanics and hamstring coactivation similar to healthy control limbs during daily activities requiring the weight-bearing knees to bend through a large range of motion (e.g., stand-to-sit). Three-dimensional knee mechanics and quadriceps and hamstring electromyographic data were collected from 8 patients with a unilateral bicompartmental knee system and 10 healthy control participants. No differences in frontal-plane knee mechanics and hamstring coactivation were found among the surgical, contralateral, and control limbs during stand-to-sit (p > .05).},

   abstract = {Background. Compared to the design of a traditional multi-axis total knee arthroplasty, the single-axis arthroplasty studied has a fixed flexion/extension center of rotation in the femoral component. The influence of this characteristic on functional daily activity, i.e., stand-to-sit, is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different arthroplasty designs on knee kinematic and lower limb muscular activation for the stand-to-sit movement.
Methods. Sixteen unilateral, posterior-stabilized knee arthroplasty participants (8 single-axis and 8 multi-axis) with excellent Knee Society scores performed 4 trials of the stand-to-sit test. Three-dimensional video analysis of whole body and joint kinematics and electromyography analysis of quadriceps and hamstrings were conducted. One-way ANOVAs were used for statistical analyses (alpha = 0.05).
Findings. The multi-axis group showed some functional adaptations while sitting down. The single-axis group exhibited less arthroplasty limb quadriceps electromyography and hamstring co-activation electromyography than the multi-axis group. For the arthroplasty limb, single-axis demonstrated less abduction angular displacement and reached peak abduction earlier than the multi-axis arthroplasty limb. The estimated effect size for this study was 0.196.
Interpretation. The single-axis design requires less eccentric knee extensor muscle activation and exhibits greater medio-lateral stability than the multi-axis designs. Findings from this study could provide useful information to orthopedic knee surgeons and rehabilitative specialists. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Objective: To investigate the psychometric properties of the five-repetition sit-to-stand test, a functional strength test, in children with spastic diplegia.
Design: Methodology study.
Settings: Hospital, laboratory or home.
Participants: In total, 108 children with spastic diplegia and 62 with typical development aged from five to 12 years were tested. For test-retest reliability, 22 children with spastic diplegia were tested twice within one week.
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main measures: The five-repetition sit-to-stand test measures time needed to complete five consecutive sit-to-stand cycles as quickly as possible. The higher the rate of five-repetition sit-to-stand (repetitions per second), the more strength a person has.
Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients of intra-session reliability and test-retest reliability were 0.95 and 0.99 respectively. The minimal detectable difference was 0.06 rep/sec. The convergent validity of the five-repetition sit-to-stand test was supported by significant correlation with one-repetition maximum of the loaded sit-to-stand test, isometric muscle strength, scores of Gross Motor Function Measure, and gait function (r or rho = 0.40-0.78). For known group validity, children with typical development and children classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System level I performed higher rates of five-repetition sit-to-stand than children classified as level II, and children classified as level II performed higher rates than level III.
Conclusion: The five-repetition sit-to-stand test was a reliable and valid test to measure functional muscle strength in children with spastic diplegia in clinics.},

The condition is made clear that an open planar curve expressed using the natural equation becomes closed, which is cut in three portions and connected with two circular arcs.
A new method for synthesizing the curve generating mechanism is presented based on the one-to-one correspondence between the points on the coupler curve and the ones on the desired curve so that the norm with respect to their natural equations may be minimized and the coordinate transformation of the coupler curve so that the maximum difference between both curves may be minimized.

A valid and feasible tool is needed to help clinicians quantify the ability of people with balance disorders to perform transitional movements. The purpose of this study was to describe the concurrent and discriminative validity of data obtained with the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST). The FTSST was compared with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI). Subjects and Methods. Eighty-one subjects without balance disorders and 93 subjects with balance disorders were recruited for the study. Each subject was asked to stand from a 43-cm-high chair 5 times as quickly as possible. The ABC and DGI scores were recorded. Results. Subjects with balance disorders performed the FTSST more slowly than subjects without balance disorders. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that the FTSST correctly identified 65% of subjects with balance dysfunction, the ABC identified 80%, and the DGI identified 78%. The ability of the FTSST to identify subjects with balance dysfunction was better for subjects younger than 60 years of age (81%). Discussion and Conclusion. The FTSST displays discriminative and concurrent validity properties that make this test potentially useful in clinical decision making, although overall the ABC and the DGI arc better than the FTSST at discriminating between subjects with and subjects without balance disorders.},

This study examined both step-up and sit-to-stand tasks performed by service members using C-Leg and PK systems to determine if the addition of positive power generation to a prosthetic knee can improve symmetry and reduce impact to the remaining joints.

The performance of the PK relative to the C-Leg during a STS task illustrated few differences between components and no effect on the intact limb. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {While Sit-to-Stand and Stand-to-Sit are routine activities and are crucial pre-requisites to walking and running their underlying dynamics are poorly understood. Furthermore, the potential for using these movements to regenerate energy in energy-sensitive devices such as orthoses, prostheses and humanoid robots has never been examined. Insights in this domain can lead to more energy-efficient prosthesis, orthosis and humanoid robot designs. OBJECTIVES: The objectives are two-fold: first, to determine how much energy can be regenerated during standard movements related to transitions between sitting and standing on a scale humanoid model and second, to determine if the chosen actuator could produce better results if the gear ratio were modified. This manuscript's main contribution to the literature is by showing which joint provides the most regenerative effect during transitions between sitting and standing. MODEL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION: Joint trajectories from existing biomechanics trials of sitting and standing transitions were fed into a 1/10 scale model of a humanoid robot. The robot model, developed in MapleSim, is comprised of standard and off-the-shelf subcomponents, including amplifier, NiMH battery and Robotis Dynamixel RX-28 actuators. RESULTS: Using the RX-28 actuator, the ankle, knee and hip joints all show a degree of regenerative effects, the hip demonstrates the most dramatic levels during the transition from standing to sitting. This contrasts with recent publications which show that the knee has the most important regenerative effects during walking and running. It is also found that for under 3 degree trajectory error the regenerative effect is best for all joints when the gear ratio is increased from the RX-28's 193: 1 value to a value of approximately 760: 1 for the ankle, 630: 1 for the knee and 600: 1 for the hip. CONCLUSIONS: During transitions between sitting and standing the greatest potential for regeneration occurs in the hips. Therefore, systems designed to implement regenerative effects between sitting and standing need to include subsystems at the hip for maximum regenerative effects.},

However, the majority of contemporary feature-based systems cannot handle the interactions of features in practical applications. Feature interactions cause problems in feature recognition as well as feature-based design systems. This paper presents an approach to represent and analyse features in a feature-based design system. In this system, a part is modelled by volumetric machining features, which are then decomposed into air volumes and material volumes. Geometric reasoning is used to evaluate and analyse the features incrementally during the design stage. Feature interactions are detected by the possible interactions among material volumes. Several interacted or face-contacted material volumes can be clustered into a single-material volume. For each material volume, a tool-swept volume is generated to represent the space to be removed in the machining process. The complete feature instancing process is governed by the validation rules to ensure that the part is manufacturable.},

Of the many existing methods, the ICP (iterative closest point) is the most popular one. However, the traditional ICP method still has certain drawbacks. In this paper an improved method is presented which is called IDCP (iterative dual closest point). The improvements are demonstrated from three aspects. One is the data organisation form. We design a novel structure which is called adaptive roulette. It can adjust the area of its cell according to the number of points and put data points into different cells. This form can make it efficient to search the nearest neighbouring point. The second is the core method IDCP. When we construct the points pair we not only use the minimum Euclidean distance rule, but also refer to the comparability of normals of the points concerned. This will increase the accuracy and decrease the iteration times significantly. The third is integration of the two view pairs. We give a way to integrate the two triangle sets by avoiding the conflict in topology of modelling.},

Thirty young-adult male Subjects participated in this study (M age = 20.7 yr; SD = 2.6). Subjects performed the two movements from a chair height adjusted to the subject's lower thigh length. In the self-administered (SA) condition, Subjects voluntarily stood LIP from the chair without instruction, and in the assigned-ordered (AO) condition Subjects stood LIP from the chair as fast as possible. Vertical floor reaction force and electromyograms of the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior muscles were measured, and 15 parameters were selected. The parameters in the phase between the peak value of the floor reaction force and completion of the movement was highly reliable regardless of instruction. However, other parameters had different reliabilities between the instruction conditions. In particular, the parameters in the phase between starting the movement and the peak value of the floor reaction force under the assigned-order were higher than those of the self-administered condition. Moreover, the sit-to-stand movement was conducted faster in the assigned-order condition during the phase between starting the movement and buttocks-syneresis, and the peak value of the floor reaction force and completion of the movement. From the above, in the assigned-order condition "as fast as possible," the anteflexion bending movement and extension of knee and trunk joints were faster, and anteflexion movement was repeated more similarly under a concrete instruction Such as moving as fast as possible.},

Sixty elderly females who can achieve a STS movement by themselves and 30 healthy young females were measured for ground reaction force during STS movement from a chair, adjusted for lower leg length height. The elderly's physical activity and failing risk were also assessed. Physical activity and failing risk significantly correlated with parameters on force exertion during hip lift-off and knee-hip joint extension phases (|r| = 0.26-0.41). Significant differences were found in ground reaction force parameters of all phases between the young and the elderly and STS movement of the elderly was suggested to result in poor force exertion and slowing down. The above tendency was noticeable in the hip lift-off and knee-hip joint extension phases. in conclusion, force exertion in hip lift-off and knee-hip joint extension phases of STS movement is related to physical activity and falling risk in the elderly. These phases may be useful to evaluate the elderly's physical activity and falling risk. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Fifty elderly females performed an STS movement twice from a chair adjusted to their knee height and the GRF, lower limb muscle mass and isometric knee extension muscle strength were measured. Reliabilities of GRF parameters were high (intra-class correlation coefficient = ICC = 0.70-0.95). Parameters on force output during trunk flexion phase (ground reaction force at hip-lift off, sum of force output between beginning of STS movement and hip-lift off) differed significantly between trials, but their effect sizes were small (0.15-0.23). GRF parameters during hip-lift off and knee-hip joint extension phases significantly correlated with knee extension strength (|r| = 0.29-0.64) but not lower limb muscle mass. In conclusion, the reliability of GRF during STS movement is good in hip-lift off and knee-hip joint extension phases and these phases relate significantly with lower limbmuscle function.

In particular, the minimum jerk and minimum torque-change models were examined. Three patterns of sit-to-stand movement from a chair, i.e., upright, natural, and leaning forward, were measured in five young participants using a 3-D motion analysis device (200 Hz). The trajectory of the center of mass and its smoothness were examined, and the optimal trajectories predicted by both models were evaluated. Trajectories of the center of mass predicted by the minimum torque-change model, rather than the minimum jerk model, resembled the measured movements in all rising movement patterns. The upright pattern required greater extension torque of the knee and ankle joints at the instant of seat-off. The leaning-forward pattern required greater extension hip torque and higher movement cost than the natural and upright patterns. These results indicate that the natural sit-to-stand movement might be a result of dynamic optimization.},

   abstract = {Background: For middle-aged and elderly women, age-related decline in an index representing power production during STS task (STS-PI), calculated by using an equation reported previously, has been shown to be greater than that in the force generation capability of lower extremity. Whether this is specific to women remains unclear. This study examined how the age-related changes in knee extensor strength and power production during STS differ between Japanese men and women aged 65 years or older.
Methods: The time taken for a 10-times-repeated STS test (STS time) and force developed during maximal voluntary isometric knee extension (KE-F) were determined in Japanese younger-old (262 men and 285 women) aged 65-74 years and older-old (96 men and 89 women) aged 75-90 years. STS-PI was calculated using the following equation: STS-PI = (body height -0.4) x body mass x 10/STS time.
Results: KE-F and STS-PI were significantly greater in the younger-old than in the older-old group (p < 0.0001) and in men than in women (p < 0.0001). STS-PI and KE-F, expressed as the percentages of the mean value of the corresponding variable for the younger-old group (% STS-PI and % KE-F, respectively), were negatively correlated to chronological age in both men (r = -0.386 and r = -0.269, respectively, p < 0.0001) and women (r = -0.504 and r = -0.294, respectively, p < 0.0001). Regression slopes in the relationship between age and % KE-F were not significantly different between men (-1.521) and women (-1.618). However, regression slope in the relationship between age and % STS-PI was significantly steeper in women (-3.108) than in men (-2.170) (p < 0.05). In OOG, % KE-F had no significant effect of sex, but % STS-PI was significantly lower in women than in men (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: In Japanese men and women aged 65 years or over, age-related loss in power production during STS is steeper in women than in men, with greater magnitude than that in knee extensor strength. This suggests a higher priority of improving power generation capability during whole-body movement such as STS in older women than in older men.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a method of determining the approximate swept volume of Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces or solids. The method consists of (1) slicing the NURBS surfaces or solids by finding the intersection of plane/surface; (2) forming the sliced curves; (3) setting up the local moving coordinate system; (4) determining the characteristic (also called singular) points or curves by obtaining local maxima points at discrete frames during motion and with respect to a local moving coordinate system; (5) fitting each NURBS singular surface; (6) trimming the singular surfaces to obtain the boundary of the final approximate swept volumes by the surface/surface intersection and perturbation method. The local moving coordinate system is set up in reference to the motion direction of the rigid body as determined from its composite velocity vector. This work aims to develop a rigorous method for identifying and visualizing the approximate swept volume generated as a result of sweeping a NURBS surface or solid. The method and numerical algorithm are illustrated through examples.},

Methods: Eight children with spastic diplegia and five typically developing children, aged 4-6 years, participated in this study. The CP participants performed STS movements immediately before and after a 40-min NDT session. Using a three-dimensional, four-camera analysis system, angular movements involving the hip, knee and ankle joints of the participants were obtained. Results: During forward tilt of the trunk, the maximum and final angles after the NDT session significantly decreased compared with those before the session (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Moreover, the final hip flexion after the session also significantly decreased compared with that before the session (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the initial, maximum and final ankle dorsiflexion angles after the session were significantly greater (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) than before the session. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a single NDT session enables children with CP to stand from a seated position without using some atypical movement patterns.},

Design: The subjects were 50 children with CP, aged from three years and two months to twelve years and four months, mean age nine years and eleven months. The control group consisted of ten healthy children, aged from four years and five months to eleven years and ten months, mean age seven years and two months. In the analysis, firstly, pictures of the subjects' (CP and control group) STS movements were taken from the side with one digital video camera. Next, these STS movements were classified into two phases (first phase, sitting position to hip off the seat; second phase, hip off the seat to standing position), and the state of the subjects' extremities was evaluated by 15 items. Based on these 15 items, characteristics of STS movements were identified and recorded as YES or NO. Finally, using SPSS (version13), cluster analysis was conducted.
Results: The subjects' STS movements were classified into five aggregate groups.
Conclusion: From these findings, it was possible to distinguish the characteristics and differences of STS movements in healthy children and CP subjects. Moreover, the CP subjects were also able to be classified into four groups based on their shared characteristics of STS movements.},

In order to assess the STS movements before and after PT, a motion analysis system was used. STS movements data before and after PT which included the total duration of STS movement and angular movement of each joint were collected and compared.
Results. The total duration of STS movement was 3.06 s before PT and 2.44 s after PT. As for angular movement before PT, knee, hip joint, and trunk were flexed strongly just after ankle joint was in plantarflexion, in shifting the center of mass forward. In contrast, these flexion patterns were less noticeable after PT. In addition, standing postures showed marked improvement. Range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion was -25 degrees before PT; after PT, it was 6 degrees.
Conclusion. These findings lead us to conclude that the effect of PT on STS movement before and after PT showed objective kinematic data.},

   abstract = {Background: Slowness of movement is a factor that may cause a decrease of quality of daily life. Mobility in the elderly and people with movement impairments may be improved by increasing the quickness of fundamental locomotor tasks. Because it has not been revealed how much muscle strength is required to improve quickness, the purpose of this study was to reveal the relation between movement time and the required muscle strength in a sit to stand (STS) task. Previous research found that the sum of the peak hip and knee joint moments was relatively invariant throughout a range of movement patterns (Yoshioka et al., 2007, Biomedical Engineering Online 6: 26). The sum of the peak hip and knee joint moment is an appropriate index to evaluate the muscle strength required for an STS task, since the effect of the movement pattern variation can be reduced, that is, the results can be evaluated purely from the viewpoint of the movement times. Therefore, the sum of the peak hip and knee joint moment was used as the index to indicate the required muscle strength.
Methods: Experimental kinematics data were collected from 11 subjects. The time at which the vertical position of the right shoulder fell outside three standard deviations of the vertical positions during the static initial posture was regarded as the start time. The time at which the vertical position fell within three standard deviations of the vertical positions during static upright standing posture was regarded as the finish time. Each movement time of the experimental movements was linearly lengthened and shortened through post-processing. Combining the experimental procedure and the post-processing, movements having various movement patterns and a wide range of movement times were obtained. The joint moment and the static and inertial components of the joint moment were calculated with an inverse dynamics method. The static component reflects the gravitational and/or external forces, while the inertial component reflects the acceleration of the body.
Results: The quantitative relation between the movement time and the sum of the peak hip and knee joint moments were obtained. As the STS movement time increased, the joint moments decreased exponentially and converged to the static component (1.51 similar to 1.54 N.m/kg). When the movement time was the longest (movement time: 7.0 seconds), the joint moments (1.57 N.m/kg) closely corresponded to the minimum of 1.53 N.m/kg as reported by Yoshioka et al..
Conclusion: The key findings of this study are as follows. (1) The minimum required joint moment for an STS task is essentially equivalent to the static component of the joint moment. (2) For fast and moderate speed movements (less than 2.5 seconds), joint moments increased exponentially as the movement speed increased. (3) For slow movements greater than 2.5 seconds, the joint moments were relatively constant. The results of this STS research has practical applications, especially in rehabilitations and exercise prescription where improved movement time is an intended target, since the required muscle strength can be quantitatively estimated.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to reveal the minimum required muscle force for a sit-to-stand task. Combining experimental procedures and computational processing, movements of various sit-to-stand patterns were obtained. Muscle forces and activations during a movement were calculated with an inverse dynamics method and a static numerical optimization method. The required muscle force for each movement was calculated with peak muscle activation, muscle physiological cross sectional area and specific tension. The robustness of the results was quantitatively evaluated with sensitivity analyses. From the results, a distinct threshold was found for the total required muscle force of the hip and knee extensors. Specifically, two findings were revealed: (1) the total force of hip and knee extensors is appropriate as the index of minimum required muscle force for a sit-to-stand task and (2) the minimum required total force is within the range of 35.3-49.2 N/kg. A muscle is not mechanically independent from other muscles, since each muscle has some synergetic or antagonistic muscles. This means that the mechanical threshold of one muscle varies with the force exertion abilities of other muscles and cannot be evaluated independently. At the same time, some kinds of mechanical threshold necessarily exist in the sit-to-stand task, since a muscle force is an only force to drive the body and people cannot stand up from a chair without muscles. These indicate that the existence of the distinct threshold in the result of the total required muscle force is reasonable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Previous studies have consistently reported that decreasing seat height increases the peak hip and knee joint moments; however, these findings may not apply to biomechanical changes at very low seat heights. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the effect of a large range of seat heights on peak joint moments of the lower limb during a sit-to-stand (STS) movement.
Methods: Eight healthy young subjects participated in this experiment. Each subject was instructed to stand up from six seat heights (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 cm). Joint moments were calculated with an inverse dynamics method. The sum of the hip and knee joint moments was used as the index to indicate the mechanical load of the STS movement. The effect of seat height on the mechanical load was examined with both analytical and experimental approaches.
Results: Through the analytical approach, it was revealed that the mechanical load of STS movements from low and normal seat heights (10 to 40 cm) always reaches its peak at or near the posture in which the thigh is horizontally positioned. This finding indicates that the peak value is invariant between the low and normal seat heights. Similar results were also found in the experimental approach. There were few significant differences in the peak mechanical load and the peak hip and knee joint moments between the low and normal seat heights, while they differed significantly between the low and high seat heights.
Conclusions: This study concluded that, while the peak mechanical load and the peak hip and knee joint moments increase inversely to seat height within the range of high to normal seat height (60 to 40 cm), they are invariant to the change of seat height within the range of low to normal seat height (10 to 40 cm). These findings are useful for the design of chair, the improvement in the evaluation standard of minimum sit-to-stand height tests and the development of new muscular strength test.},

   title = {Computation of the kinematics and the minimum peak joint moments of sit-to-stand movements},
   journal = {Biomedical Engineering Online},
   volume = {6},
   abstract = {Background: A sit-to-stand (STS) movement requires muscle strength higher than that of other daily activities. There are many elderly people, who experience difficulty when standing up from a chair. The muscle strength required (or the load on the joints) during a STS task is determined by the kinematics (movement pattern). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the kinematics and resultant joint moments of people standing up from a chair in order to determine the minimum peak joint moments required for a STS task.
Methods: This study consisted of three steps. In the first step, kinematic data of lower extremity joint angles (hip, knee and ankle) during STS movements were experimentally collected from human subjects. Eighty-five sets of STS kinematic data were obtained. In the second step, the experimentally collected kinematic data and a link segment model of the human body were used to generate more than 5,000,000 computed STS movements. In the third step, using inverse dynamics method, joint moments of the lower extremity were calculated for all movements obtained through the preceding steps. From the outputs of the third step, the optimal kinematics (movement pattern) in terms of minimized peak joint moment for the hip, knee and ankle was determined.
Results: The peak hip joint moment ranged from 0.24 to 1.92 N.m/kg. The peak knee joint moment ranged from 0.51 to 1.97 N.m/kg, and the peak ankle joint moment ranged from -0.11 to 1.32 N.m/kg. The optimal movement patterns differed depending on which minimized joint moment index was selected (hip, knee or ankle). However, the sum of the peak hip joint moment and peak knee joint moment was always approximately 1.53 N.m/kg regardless of which minimized joint moment index was selected.
Conclusion: The most important finding of this study was that the relation between the peak joint moments at the hip and knee joints was complementary and the sum of those moments needed to be greater than 1.53 N.m/kg in order to perform a successful STS. A combined hip-knee value of 1.5 N.m/kg or lower may indicate the need for physical rehabilitation and/or exercise to increase muscular force.},

Design. Two-dimensional video analysis of whole body and joint kinematics.
Background. A biomechanical model that describes the whole body linear motions as functions of lower extremity joint angular motions is needed to provide clinically relevant information in clinical services and scientific research.
Methods. The linear velocity vector of the whole body motion during the sit-to-stand movement was partitioned into horizontal and vertical components and expressed as functions of lower extremity joint angular velocities for 10 healthy subjects. The coefficient of joint contribution to the whole body linear velocity vector was determined for each joint in each direction.
Results. The ankle and hip angular motions are critical to the development of the forward horizontal velocity of the whole body during the sit-to-stand movement. The knee and hip angular motions are critical to the development of the upward vertical velocity of the whole body during the sit-to-stand movement.
Conclusions. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angular motions have various roles in whole body motions in different directions of the sit-to-stand movement.

Design: Single-case study.
Setting: Motion research laboratory.
Participant: A 24-year-old man who was 3.5 years post-TBI.
Interventions: Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures: Peak horizontal and vertical velocities of the whole-body COM and peak angular velocities of the ankle, knee, hip, and shoulder joints.
Results: The peak whole-body COM vertical velocity was significantly lower in the unsuccessful STS trials. Angular velocities at the hip, knee, ankle, and shoulder joints in successful trials exceeded those in unsuccessful trials (P<.001). The subject's peak knee extension velocity was the single major predictor of the peak whole-body COM vertical velocity (r(2)=.90). Knee extension angular velocities greater than 3.25 radian/s Were associated with successful STS trials. Knee extension angular velocities between 2.75 and 3.25 radian/s were associated with successful rising 50% of the time; the subject had no success in rising when velocities were less than 2.75radian/s.
Conclusions: For this subject, sit-back failures occurred in STS attempts characterized by peak whole-body COM vertical velocities that were lower than those generated in successful rising trials. These unsuccessful rising attempts were primarily the result of the subject's inability to generate sufficient knee extension angular velocity.},

   abstract = {Background: Individuals with COPD may present reduced peripheral muscle strength, leading to impaired mobility. Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength training, in particular to lower limbs. Furthermore, simple tools for the assessment of peripheral muscle performance are required.
Objectives: To assess the peripheral muscle performance of COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST), as compared to the one-repetition maximum (1-RM), considered as the gold standard for assessing muscle strength in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the responsiveness of STST to a PR program.
Methods: Sixty moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included into either the specific strength training group or into the usual PR program group. Patients were assessed on a 30-second STST and 1-minute STST, 1-RM, and 6-minute walking test (6MWT), before and after PR. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement between 1-RM and STST.
Results: The two groups were not different at baseline. In all patients, 1-RM was significantly related to the 30-second STST (r=0.48, P<0.001) and to 1-minute STST (r=0.36, P=0.005). The 30-second STST was better tolerated in terms of the perceived fatigue (P=0.002) and less time consuming (P<0.001) test. In the specific strength training group significant improvements were observed in the 30-second STST (P<0.001), 1-minute STST (P=0.005), 1-RM (P<0.001), and in the 6MWT (P=0.001). In the usual PR program group, significant improvement was observed in the 30-second STST (P=0.042) and in the 6MWT (P=0.001).
Conclusion: Our study shows that in stable moderate-to-severe inpatients with COPD, STST is a valid and reliable tool to assess peripheral muscle performance of lower limbs, and is sensitive to a specific PR program.},

The position and orientation of a rigid body can be described with an element of the group of spatial rigid body displacements, SE(3). To find a smooth motion that interpolates a given set of positions and orientations is therefore the same as finding an interpolating curve between the corresponding elements of SE(3). To make the interpolation on SE(3) independent of the representation of the group, we use the coordinate-fret framework of differential geometry. It is necessary to choose inertial and body-fixed reference frames to describe the position and orientation of the rigid body. We first show that trajectories that are independent of the choice of these frames can be obtained by using the exponential map on SE(3). However, these trajectories may exhibit rapid changes in the velocity or higher derivatives. The second contribution of the paper is a method for finding the maximally smooth interpolating curve. By adapting the techniques of the calculus of variations to SE(3), necessary conditions are derived for motions that are equivalent to cubic splines in the Euclidean space. These necessary conditions result in a boundary value problem with interior-point constraints. A simple and efficient numerical method for finding a solution is then described. Finally, we discuss the dependence of the computed trajectories on the metric on SE(3) and show that independence of the trajectories from the choice of the reference frames can be achieved by using a suitable metric.

The main idea is to define a functional depending on velocity or its derivatives that measures smoothness of trajectories and find a trajectory that minimizes this functional, In order to ensure that the computed trajectories are independent of the parameterization of positions and orientations, we use the notions of Riemannian metric and covariant derivative from differential geometry and formulate the problem as a variational problem on the Lie group of spatial rigid body displacements, SE(3). We show that by choosing an appropriate measure of smoothness, the trajectories can be made to satisfy boundary conditions on the velocities or higher order derivatives, Dynamically smooth trajectories can be obtained by incorporating the inertia of the system into the definition of the Riemannian metric. We state the necessary conditions for the shortest distance, minimum acceleration and minimum jerk trajectories. Analytical expressions for the smooth trajectories are derived for some special cases.

This paper presents a unified approach to optimal pose trajectory planning for robot manipulators in Cartesian space through a genetic algorithm (GA) enhanced optimization of the pose ruled surface. The robot pose ruled surface is formed as a motion locus of its configuration vector. The unified treatment of the end-effector positions and orientations is based on the robot pose ruled surface concept and used in trajectory interpolations. The planning of robot pose trajectories is accomplished through the way of generating and optimizing robot pose ruled surfaces under the constraints of kinematics, dynamics and control performances. The optimization model is established based on functional analysis and dynamics planning, and instantiated by using high-order parametric space curves as position and orientation trajectories. A GA enhanced optimization method is used to choose the parameters (coefficients) of space curves such that the pose ruled surface and its area and area change ratios are optimized for achieving good kinematics and dynamics performances. With robot's dynamics constraints taken into account, the optimized trajectories are realizable and robust for control. Two cases are studied to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Results: Inability to complete 5tSTS was a marginal predictor of falls (OR = 4.22) and a significant predictor of ADL- (OR = 24.70) and IADL-related disability (OR = 17.10) at 3-year follow-up. The need of longer time to complete 5tSTS was predictive of developing IADL-related disability at 3-year follow-up (OR = 4.22 [> 16.6 s]; OR = 2.49 [13.7 - 16.6 s]). Discussion: 5tSTS is an easily administered tool which can be used to predict subsequent ADL- and IADL-related disability.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the classical Burmester problem of the exact synthesis of a planar four-bar mechanism with up to five task positions. A novel algorithm is presented that uses prescribed task positions to obtain “candidate” manifolds and then find feasible constraint manifolds among them. The first part is solved by null space analysis, and the second part is reduced to finding the solution of two quadratic equations. Five-position synthesis could be solved exactly with up to four resulting dyads. For four-position synthesis, a limited number of solutions could be selected from the ∞1 many through adding an additional linear constraint equation without increasing the computational complexity. This linear constraint equation could be obtained either by defining one of the coordinates of the center/circle points, by picking the ground line/coupler line, or by adding one additional task position, all of which are proved to be able to convert into the same form as in (23). For three-position synthesis, two additional constraints could be imposed in the same way to select from the ∞2 many solutions. The result is a novel algorithm that is simple and efficient, which allows for task driven design of four-bar linkages with both revolute and prismatic joints, as well as handling of different kinds of additional constraint conditions in the same way.},

In a recent work, we developed a simple algorithm for analyzing a set of given task positions to determine all feasible planar dyads with revolute and/or prismatic joints that can be used to guide through the given positions. This paper extends this algorithm to the integrated joint type and dimensional synthesis of Watt I and II and Stephenson I, II, and III six-bar linkages that contain both R- and P-joints. In the process, we developed a new classification for planar six-bar linkages according to whether the end-effector can be constrained by two dyads (type I), one dyad (type II), or no dyad (type III). In the end, we demonstrate this task-driven synthesis approach with three examples including a novel six-bar linkage for lifting an individual with age disability from seating position to standing position.},

The sensor suit of the system includes three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and eight force sensors. The system was built to measure both kinematic (tilt angles) and dynamic (ground contact forces) signals of human gaits. To evaluate the recognition performance of the system, seven motion modes and sit-to-stand transition were monitored. With a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, the proposed system can accurately classify the current states. The overall motion mode recognition accuracy was 99.9% during the stance phase and 98.5% during the swing phase. For sit-to-stand transition recognition, the average accuracy was 99.9%. These promising results show the potential of the designed system for the control of intelligent prostheses.},

The requirements for fixed pivot positions, no branch defect, crank existence and link length ratio are taken as constraints, and the transmission angle is aimed to be optimal when adjustable four-bar linkages are synthesized. A modified genetic algorithm is employed to seek the global optimal solution. Results of two synthesis examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {This study presents an analysis of power exertion for lifting the body's centre of mass (CoM) during rising from a chair. Five healthy young (21-44 years) and 12 healthy older (70-79 years) subjects performed sit-to-stand (STS) movements while data were measured with force-plates underneath chair and feet and motion sensors attached to different locations on the upper and lower trunk. Force-plate-data were used to determine the timing of STS movements and the vertical power for lifting the CoM from a sitting to a standing position. Data of three-dimensional hybrid motion sensors, consisting of accelerometers, gyroscopes and earth-magnetic-field sensors, were used to determine vertical accelerations and power. The comparison of sensor-based estimations of peak power with peak power calculated from force-plate-data demonstrated fair to excellent linear relationships for all sensor locations on the trunk. The best approximation of peak power was obtained by a weighted combination of data measured at different trunk locations. Results of the older subjects were consistent with those of the young subjects performing slow, normal and fast STS movements. The presented approach is relevant for monitoring fall risk and assessment of mobility in older people. Similar approaches for assessing power may be developed for other mobility related activities, such as stair walking, or sports related activities such as jumping. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The kinematic synthesis of planar linkage mechanisms has traditionally been broken into the categories of motion, path, and function generation. Each of these categories of problems has been solved separately. Many problems in engineering practice require some combination of these problem types. For example, a problem requiring coupler points and/or poses in addition to specific input and/or output link angles that correspond to those positions. A limited amount of published work has addressed some specific underconstrained combinations of these problems. This paper presents a general graphical method for the synthesis of a four bar linkage to satisfy any combination of these exact synthesis problems that is not overconstrained. The approach is to consider the constraints imposed by the target positions on the linkage through the poles and rotation angles. These pole and rotation angle constraints (PRCs) are necessary and sufficient conditions to meet the target positions. After the constraints are made, free choices which may remain can be explored by simply dragging a fixed pivot, a moving pivot, or a pole in the plane. The designer can thus investigate the family of available solutions before making the selection of free choices to satisfy other criteria. The fully constrained combinations for a four bar linkage are given and sample problems are solved for several of them.},
